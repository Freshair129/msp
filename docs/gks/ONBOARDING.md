# Onboarding — adopting GKS in an existing project

A pragmatic, **incremental** path to bring GKS into a project that already has
code and (probably) scattered docs in Notion / Confluence / Slack threads.

> **Golden rule.** Don't migrate everything on day one. Migrate what you'll
> touch again. Empty atoms are worse than no atoms — they fool readers into
> thinking the SSOT is complete when it isn't.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node 20+
- A git repository (GKS audit + drift hooks assume one)
- Optional: Postgres with pgvector, or Qdrant — only when atoms exceed ~100
  and you need semantic recall

You do **not** need an LLM API key to start. The Three-Gate Consolidator and
embeddings are pluggable; file backends work for everything else.

---

## Phase 0 — Install + bootstrap (5 minutes)

```sh
cd my-existing-project
npm install @gks/core
npx gks init
```

`gks init` creates:

```
gks/                       ← atom folders, flat layout (ADR-013)
  adr/  concept/  feat/  frame/  blueprint/
  issues/  runbook/  inc/  ...
.brain/default/            ← storage (audit, atomic_index, vectors)
gks.config.json            ← namespace + backends
scripts/msp/re-indexer.ts  ← walks gks/**/*.md → atomic_index.jsonl
```

Default config uses **file backends** — no external services needed:

```jsonc
{ "namespace": "default",
  "backends": { "vector": "file", "graph": "file" },
  "audit":    { "enabled": true } }
```

Add to `.gitignore` (the init step does this for you):

```gitignore
.brain/**/audit/
.brain/**/vectors/
```

`atomic_index.jsonl` **is** committed — it's deterministic and reviewable.

---

## Phase 1 — Capture 3 decisions you've already made

The single highest-ROI step. Pick three decisions that your team has
**already made** but never wrote down — usually they live in Slack, in
someone's head, or in a closed PR description.

Examples:

- *"Why Postgres over MongoDB?"*
- *"Why JWT instead of session cookies?"*
- *"Why BullMQ instead of SQS?"*

Each becomes one ADR:

```sh
# Copy the template directly to its canonical folder
cp examples/atom-templates/ADR.md gks/adr/ADR--POSTGRES-CHOICE.md
# fill in frontmatter + body

# Commit and create a PR for review
git add gks/adr/ADR--POSTGRES-CHOICE.md
git commit -m "docs: define postgres choice"
```

Or create a branch and author multiple atoms:

```sh
git checkout -b docs/initial-adr
# ... author files ...
git add gks/
git commit -m "docs: record initial decisions"
```

Stop here for the day. Three ADRs is a working SSOT.

---

## Phase 2 — Link atoms to existing code (`linked_symbols`)

Pick 5–10 **hot files** — code that's edited often, breaks often, or is
load-bearing. Add `linked_symbols:` to the atoms that govern them.

```yaml
# gks/adr/ADR--POSTGRES-CHOICE.md
---
id: ADR--POSTGRES-CHOICE
linked_symbols:
  - { file: "src/db/client.ts" }
  - { file: "src/db/migrations/0001_init.sql" }
---
```

Re-index:

```sh
npm run msp:index
```

Verify the reverse lookup works:

```sh
gks lookup-by-symbol src/db/client.ts
# → ADR--POSTGRES-CHOICE   adr   "Postgres over MongoDB ..."
```

---

## Phase 3 — Migrate existing docs (incrementally)

**Rule of thumb:** migrate a doc only if you'll edit it again in the next
month. Read-only reference material can stay where it is.

| Existing doc                    | → atom type                       |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `README.md` § Architecture      | `FRAME--SYSTEM-OVERVIEW`          |
| `docs/api.md`                   | one `API--<endpoint>` per surface |
| `docs/runbooks/db-failover.md`  | `RUNBOOK--DB-FAILOVER`            |
| Slack thread — "decision X"     | `ADR--X`                          |
| Confluence FAQ (read-only)      | ❌ leave it                       |

Templates live in `examples/atom-templates/` — one starter per prefix.

The full taxonomy (30+ prefixes, 4 clusters) is in
[`docs/KNOWLEDGE-TYPES.md`](./KNOWLEDGE-TYPES.md).

---

## Phase 4 — Wire drift detection (real ROI starts here)

```sh
cp examples/drift-detection/pre-push.sh .git/hooks/pre-push
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

Now any push that changes a cited symbol blocks until atoms are reviewed:

```
$ git push
Pushing to origin/feat-jwt-rotation...
─ ADR--JWT-AUTH cites src/auth/jwt.ts:verify
─ verify() was modified; ADR--JWT-AUTH not updated
exit 1 — review atoms before pushing
```

Override with `git push --no-verify` only when the atom is genuinely
unaffected — and even then, prefer updating the atom.

---

## Phase 5 — Connect AI agents (Claude Code / Cursor / OpenAI)

Add an MCP server entry. For Claude Code, edit `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`:

```jsonc
{ "mcpServers": {
    "gks": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args":    ["@gks/core", "mcp"],
      "cwd":     "/path/to/my-existing-project"
} } }
```

Restart the agent. It now has 8 stdio tools:

- `gks_recall` — semantic + lexical retrieval
- `gks_lookup` / `gks_lookup_by_symbol` — exact-id / reverse-citation
- `gks_propose_inbound` — agents can suggest atoms (typically reviewed via PR in monorepos)
- `gks_retain` / `gks_reflect` / `gks_recall_cross_namespace`

The agent will start calling `gks_recall` before generating code that
duplicates an existing decision — the duplication-prevention loop closes here.

---

## Phase 6 — Self-hosted issue tracker (optional)

Skip if Linear / Jira is working for you. If you want to stop paying for
those, ISSUE-- ships out of the box (light tier — direct write, no inbound
queue):

```sh
gks issue create --title "Add 2FA flow" --priority high --label auth
gks issue list --status open
gks issue comment ISSUE--ADD-2FA "blocked on TOTP library choice"
gks issue close ISSUE--ADD-2FA --reason "shipped in v1.4"
```

Issues get the same audit trail and bi-temporal versioning as everything else.

---

## Phase 7 — Vector backend (when atoms > ~100)

Lexical recall is fine for a few dozen atoms. Beyond that, switch on a
real vector store:

```jsonc
// gks.config.json
{ "backends": {
    "vector":   { "type": "pgvector", "url": "$DATABASE_URL" },
    "embedder": { "type": "openai", "model": "text-embedding-3-small" }
} }
```

Migrate the existing index:

```sh
gks reindex --rebuild-vectors
```

`gks recall` now blends semantic + lexical with rerank. Cost tracking is
on by default — check `.brain/default/cost.jsonl`.

---

## Anti-patterns

| Don't                                          | Do                                              |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Migrate every doc on day one                   | Start with 3 ADRs you've already decided        |
| Write an ADR for every commit                  | ADR = a decision someone will ask "why?" about  |
| Skip PR review to move faster              | The review **is** the SSOT guarantee            |
| Add `linked_symbols` everywhere                | Only for atoms that actually govern code        |
| Wait for "enough" atoms before drift detection | Turn it on now — it works with whatever exists  |
| Treat empty atom shells as progress            | Better to have 5 real atoms than 50 stubs       |

---

## A realistic timeline

| Week    | Work                                       | Payoff                                   |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1       | install · 3 ADRs · `linked_symbols`        | team has somewhere to record decisions   |
| 2       | drift pre-push hook · 5–10 more atoms      | first drift caught before merge          |
| 3–4     | MCP server · agents call `gks_recall`      | agents stop duplicating prior decisions  |
| 1–2 mo  | runbooks · incident → post-mortem ADRs     | ops loop closes                          |
| 3 mo    | vector backend · cross-namespace recall    | scales to org-wide use                   |

---

## When you actually need a full migration

The incremental path above is the default because the most common failure
mode is the opposite — teams try to migrate everything on day one, burn
two weeks producing empty atom shells, lose interest, and quietly fall
back to Notion. Don't be that team.

But there are real cases where a full migration is correct:

| Situation                                         | Why incremental doesn't fit            |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Compliance / audit requires a full decision trail | No partial migration is acceptable     |
| The old doc system is being shut down             | You're migrating regardless — do it once |
| Team handoff or acquisition                       | New owners need full context, not partial |
| Total docs < 50 pages                             | The cost of incremental exceeds the cost of doing it all |
| You're already rewriting docs from scratch        | Combine the work                       |

If none of those apply, **stop and re-read Phase 1** — the incremental
path is almost certainly what you want.

### Full-migration playbook (4–8 weeks)

If a full migration is genuinely required, follow these phases. The
ordering matters — skipping the validation phase is the single biggest
predictor of failure.

**Phase A — Inventory (1–2 days).** Crawl every source (Confluence,
Notion, Slack, wiki, Google Docs) into a CSV: `source · url ·
last_edited · size · owner · proposed_type · action (migrate/archive)`.
Decision rule: edited within 90 days → migrate; edited > 1 year ago and
no owner → archive (read-only freeze); regulatory → migrate regardless.

**Phase B — Taxonomy validation (1 week).** Pick 20 representative docs
from the inventory, sit down with the team, and map each to an atom
type. If five or more don't fit cleanly, **extend the taxonomy first
before migrating anything else**. Write conversion rules per
source/folder so the bulk import is mechanical:

```ts
// scripts/migration/conversion-rules.ts
export const rules = {
  confluence: {
    'tech-decisions/*': { type: 'adr',     tier: 'strict' },
    'runbooks/*':       { type: 'runbook', tier: 'light'  },
    'faq/*':            { skip: true, reason: 'read-only' },
  },
  slack: {
    '#arch-decisions': { type: 'adr', tier: 'strict' },
    '#incidents':      { type: 'inc', tier: 'light'  },
  },
}
```

**Phase C — Bulk conversion tooling (1 week).** Build the converters
once, run them many times:

```
scripts/migration/
├── confluence-export.ts   ← API → markdown + frontmatter
├── notion-export.ts       ← notion-api → markdown
├── slack-thread.ts        ← thread → ADR scaffold (body needs human edit)
└── batch-import.ts        ← drops everything in gks/_inbound/
```

**Phase D — Mass import (2–4 weeks).** Strict-tier atoms (ADR,
BLUEPRINT, FRAME) require human review. Light-tier (RUNBOOK, INC,
CONCEPT-as-FAQ) can be bulk-promoted.

```sh
git add gks/adr/
git commit -m "docs: bulk import ADRs"
```

**Critical guardrail:** cap reviews at ≤ 20 strict-tier atoms per day.
Beyond that, reviewer fatigue produces rubber-stamps and the SSOT loses
trust before it earns it. Track quota in CI:

```sh
gks inbound stats --since today
# review_count: 12  approved: 11  rejected: 1
# 8 / 20 daily quota remaining
```

**Phase E — Backfill `linked_symbols` (ongoing, 2+ weeks).** Use AST or
grep heuristics to *suggest* code symbols per atom; require human
confirmation. Never auto-apply — false positives poison drift detection.

```sh
node scripts/migration/suggest-symbols.ts \
  --atom gks/adr/ADR--JWT-AUTH.md \
  --code-root src/
→ src/auth/jwt.ts:verify        (confidence 0.92)
  src/auth/middleware.ts:authn  (confidence 0.78)
[a]ccept all · [s]elect · [m]anual · [q]uit
```

**Phase F — Sunset old systems (1 week).** Banner every old page
(*"migrated to gks/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;ID&gt;, read-only as of YYYY-MM-DD"*),
redirect URLs where possible, and run a smoke test: can the team do a
full day's work using only GKS? If not, find the gap before flipping
old systems to read-only.

### Even when you full-migrate, don't skip Phase 1

Spend the first two days writing **three ADRs you've already decided**
(Phase 1 of the incremental path) before touching the inventory. This
is dogfooding — it surfaces taxonomy bugs and tooling gaps at scale 3,
not scale 200. The cost is two days; the cost of finding the same bugs
after a 100-atom import is a re-migration.

```
Day 1–2:  Phase 1 — three already-made ADRs (validate taxonomy + tools)
Day 3–5:  Phase A — inventory
Week 2:   Phase B — taxonomy validation (now informed by real use)
Week 3:   Phase C — tooling
Week 4–7: Phase D — mass import
Week 6+:  Phase E — linked_symbols backfill (overlaps)
Week 8:   Phase F — sunset
```
