# Handover Report: Knowledge Architecture & Doc-to-Code Standardization
**Date:** 2026-05-11
**Status:** ✅ Phase A Complete (Architectural Alignment & GksV3 Sync)

## 1. Executive Summary
Today we evolved the MSP/GKS ecosystem from a flat atomic storage model into a hierarchical **Master-Genesis-Atomic** framework. This ensures that knowledge isn't just stored (Atomic), but is composed into "runnable" units (Genesis) and absolute governance (Master). We also hardened the **Doc-to-Code** workflow to prevent agent hallucinations and SSOT corruption.

## 2. Architectural Standardization
We have formalized the following hierarchy:
- **Atomic (GKS Layer)**: The foundational storage engine. Standardized prefixes defined in `GksV3/docs/KNOWLEDGE-TYPES.md`.
- **Genesis Block (Composition Layer)**: A functional knowledge unit consisting of at least 3 atoms: **Concept** (intent), **Protocol** (interaction), and **Algorithm** (logic).
- **Master Block (Governance Layer)**: Absolute, context-invariant knowledge (e.g., `DOC-TO-CODE` governance).

## 3. Key Implementations & Edits

### GksV3 (Storage Engine)
- **`docs/KNOWLEDGE-TYPES.md`**: Broadened the definition of `FRAME--` to include architectural frameworks and methodologies (Master/Genesis definitions).
- **`docs/MSP_RELATIONSHIP.md`**: Upgraded to reflect the current state of MSP (TypeScript). Removed stale references to the "inbound queue" and marked the system as **Agent-Agnostic**.

### MSP (Memory OS)
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Added a **Mandatory Context Tracing** rule. Agents MUST read all `crosslinks` and `Source` references before modifying or implementing code derived from an atom.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Formally adopted **Qwen CLI** (python `G:\qwen-cli\qwen.py`) for attempts 1-3 of microtasks, with **Gemini CLI** as the escalation layer.
- **`upstream/gks-proposals/SUBMISSION.md`**: Updated to record that Issue 6 and 7 were implemented directly into the GksV3 master branch.

## 4. Workflows & Rules
1. **Context First**: Do not touch code until you have traced the entire knowledge graph related to the task.
2. **Atomic Integrity**: Every write to `gks/` must follow the validator rules.
3. **Escalation Path**: If an SLM (Qwen) fails a microtask 3 times, it MUST be escalated to the T2 layer (Gemini).

## 5. Next Steps for Successor Agent
- [x] **Genesis Implementation**: Completed IDENTITY module (MOD/PROTOCOL/ALGO) and updated AUDIT logs.
- [x] **Codegen Runner**: Implemented real SLM (Qwen) and Escalation (Gemini) wiring per ADR.
- [ ] **Workspace Unification**: Work within the new multi-root workspace to maintain synchronization between GksV3 and MSP.
