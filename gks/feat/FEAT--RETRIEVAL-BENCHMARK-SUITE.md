# FEAT — Retrieval Benchmark Suite

## 1. Summary

The Retrieval Benchmark Suite is a specialized testing and evaluation framework designed to measure the effectiveness of the `msp_recall` orchestration. It provides objective metrics (Precision@k, Recall@k, MRR) to guide the tuning of RRF weights and verify the performance impact of new retrieval sources or re-ranking stages.

## 2. Motivation

"Retrieval quality" is often subjective and difficult to track as the knowledge base grows. Without empirical data, tuning the RRF weights (`PARAMS--RETRIEVAL-WEIGHTS`) is based on intuition rather than evidence. As we introduce more complex components like the Cross-Encoder re-ranker and pgvector backends, we need a standard "litmus test" to ensure we are actually improving search results without regressing on latency or basic recall.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Ground Truth Data
-   **Query Fixtures:** Maintain a set of representative natural language queries.
-   **Expected Results (Labels):** For each query, define a set of "relevant" atoms that should be retrieved.
-   **Versioning:** Benchmark datasets must be versioned to allow for consistent comparison over time.

### 3.2 Metric Calculation
-   **Precision@k:** The fraction of retrieved atoms that are relevant among the top-k results.
-   **Recall@k:** The fraction of all relevant atoms that were successfully retrieved in the top-k results.
-   **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank):** Measures how high the first relevant result appears in the ranked list.
-   **Latency:** Measure and report the p50, p90, and p99 latency for the entire retrieval pipeline.

### 3.3 CLI Interface
-   Provide a command `msp-recall bench [--dataset <path>] [--json]`.
-   Support running benchmarks against different configurations (e.g., re-ranking ON vs. OFF).
-   Output a summary table of metrics and a comparison report.

### 3.4 Automated Reporting
-   Integrate with the project's benchmarking infrastructure (e.g., `packages/msp/benchmarks/`).
-   Generate a Markdown report after each run, including a git SHA for traceability.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] A suite of at least 20 test queries and labeled ground-truth results exists.
-   [ ] The `msp-recall bench` command successfully calculates and reports P@k, R@k, and MRR.
-   [ ] The benchmark can clearly differentiate between a "good" and "bad" RRF weight configuration.
-   [ ] Results are stable and reproducible across multiple runs on the same hardware.

## 5. Connections
-   `[[CONCEPT--MSP-ROADMAP]]` §4 M10c.
-   `[[PARAMS--RETRIEVAL-WEIGHTS]]` — the parameters this suite helps tune.
-   `[[ADR--RETRIEVAL-RRF-FUSION]]` — the algorithm being evaluated.
