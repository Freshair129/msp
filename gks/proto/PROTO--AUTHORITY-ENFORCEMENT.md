# PROTO — AUTHORITY-ENFORCEMENT

## Rule

If a project opts into the tier model by checking in `.brain/msp/authority.yaml`,
the file must be well-formed and internally consistent:

- top-level mapping with `tiers` (T1/T2/T3 → string[]) and `allowed_paths`
  (T1/T2/T3 → string[])
- tier membership sets are disjoint (no user in two tiers)
- every entry under `tiers.<T>` and `allowed_paths.<T>` is a non-empty string
- each tier's `allowed_paths` includes at least one entry referencing the
  inbound queue (so T1 has somewhere legal to write)

If the file is absent the predicate passes vacuously — projects can opt in
when they're ready.

## Schema

Reads `<repoRoot>/.brain/msp/authority.yaml` directly. No atomic-index
inspection; the matrix is config data, not a knowledge atom. Predicate uses
`node:fs/promises.readFile` + `yaml.parse` (already a dep).

## Predicate

```ts
const predicate: Predicate = async (ctx) => {
  const path = resolve(ctx.repoRoot, '.brain/msp/authority.yaml')
  // ENOENT → vacuous pass
  // bad YAML → error
  // shape problems → list violations
}
```

Implementation: `src/validator/proto/authority-enforcement.ts`.

## Trigger

`msp:validate --all`. Runs after the regular validator rules, alongside
the other M8 PROTOs.

## Severity

`error` — once a project ships an `authority.yaml`, malformed shape should
block CI. Severity stays `draft` while the M8e rollout settles.

## Status

`draft` — gradual rollout. Promotes to `stable` after the companion CI
workflow (PR-time author/path matching) lands per `ADR--DELEGATION-POLICY`.

## Out of scope (for this PROTO)

PROTO predicates can't see the PR's git author, commit metadata, or diff.
The actual matrix enforcement (match author tier → check touched paths) is
a CI workflow concern (e.g. `.github/workflows/authority-check.yml`),
tracked in `AUDIT--AUTHORITY-ENFORCEMENT-PROTO` as future work.
