# SAFETY — PII Redaction

## Rule
Identity data and memory retrieved for a subagent MUST be redacted if it contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) not within the subagent's scope.

## Constraints
- **Subject Redaction**: The `Subject.id` should be used only for audit purposes; if exposed to a subagent, it may be pseudonymised.
- **Metadata Protection**: Atom attributes containing sensitive data (e.g., `real_name`, `email`) must be filtered out before the atom is composed into the context.

## Enforcement
The Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) in Phase 2+ handles the filtration of sensitive attributes based on the `SubagentScope`.
Specific regex-based or LLM-based PII detection is a future enhancement (M11+).
