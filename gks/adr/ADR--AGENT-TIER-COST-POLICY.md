# ADR — Agent Tier Cost Policy

## Context

Using cloud LLMs (T2/T3) incurs costs. We need a clear policy for when to escalate from local T1 to cloud tiers.

## Decision

1.  **Automatic Escalation**: If T1 fails twice on the same task (acceptance test fail), escalate to T2.
2.  **Manual Escalation**: Users can explicitly request T2/T3 for specific tasks.
3.  **Tier Cap**: 
    - T2 (Gemini Flash) is allowed for all regular feature work.
    - T3 (Claude) is restricted to `critical` severity tasks or explicitly approved sessions.
4.  **Token Budget**: Tasks exceeding 2M tokens context must use T2 (Gemini).

## Consequences

- Improved success rate for complex tasks.
- Controlled cloud spend.
- Clear path for agent self-improvement (if T1 fails, T2 fixes and T1 learns).
