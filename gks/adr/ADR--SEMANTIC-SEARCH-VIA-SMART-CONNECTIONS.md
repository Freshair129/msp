# ADR — semantic search topology

> **Updated 2026-05-04 (M7-prep follow-up)**: original decision said "MSP never embeds; Smart Connections is canonical". GksV3 3.6.0 audit found GKS now ships `createNomicEmbedder()` and a built-in vector store. Reframed: **GKS** is the canonical embedder + writer for agent-facing recall; **Smart Connections** remains for in-Obsidian human browse. Both pinned to the same model by `[[ADR--EMBEDDING-MODEL-PARITY]]`. Original alternatives still useful for context — preserved below.

## Context

Three viable architectures for semantic recall of GKS atoms:

1. **MSP-side embedder** — Node ships a model; MSP embeds queries + atoms.
2. **GKS-side embedder + Smart Connections companion for in-Obsidian browse** — GKS owns canonical vectors; SC owns the human-facing browse pane in Obsidian; both use the same model.
3. **Smart Connections only (plugin-resourced everywhere)** — original M7-prep choice; obsoleted by GksV3 3.6.0 shipping its own embedder.

Cost matters: option 1 doubles model memory if user runs Obsidian + SC. Option 3 forces every agent-facing recall through Obsidian. Option 2 lets agents work headless (no Obsidian) and humans browse through familiar SC UI — best of both.

## Decision

**Option 2 — GKS canonical + Smart Connections companion.**

### Two surfaces

| Surface | Owner | Used by | Storage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent-facing semantic recall | **GKS** (`createNomicEmbedder()` + `VectorBackend`) | `msp_recall` (M7c), MCP tools, headless CI | `.brain/.../vector/atomic.jsonl` (or HNSW / pgvector) |
| Human browse in Obsidian | **Smart Connections** | Smart View pane, "find similar notes" | `.smart-connections/` (plugin-private) |

### Constraints this creates

1. **Both surfaces must use the same embedding model.** Locked by `[[ADR--EMBEDDING-MODEL-PARITY]]` to `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. User configures Smart Connections via plugin settings; GKS uses it by default in 3.6.0.

2. **Agent-facing recall does NOT require Obsidian.** GKS vector store is independent. MSP works headless (CI, server, no GUI).

3. **Smart Connections's storage is plugin-private.** `.smart-connections/` schema is plugin-version-specific. MSP **must not** parse those files for vector arithmetic — only for diagnostics.

4. **Embedding storage is duplicated until M10a.** GKS persists vectors via `VectorBackend`; Smart Connections persists in `.smart-connections/`. ~2× storage cost accepted at typical scale (< 5,000 atoms). M10a "msp-bridge" companion plugin is the dedup path: SC reads GKS's store directly.

### Integration mechanism

For agent path (canonical):

a. **GKS adapter** — MSP imports `createNomicEmbedder()` from `@evaai/gks` (or equivalent), wraps it in M7c retrieval orchestrator. No network hop.

For human path (browse):

b. **Smart Connections plugin in Obsidian** — pre-installed by user; configured to use the canonical model.

c. **Probe at startup** — M7a checks if Obsidian REST + SC are reachable; if so, MSP can surface "open this in Smart View" deep links. Not a requirement for agent recall.

### Scale-up path

When the project outgrows JSONL (large vault, batch queries, sub-100ms latency requirement), swap GKS's `VectorBackend` to HNSW or pgvector. **No MSP change required**. Smart Connections's storage upgrade is plugin-side (M10a or equivalent) — also no MSP change.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Headless agent recall works (CI, server boot, no Obsidian needed).
- Human browse is unchanged — SC users get the familiar pane.
- Single model = vectors interchangeable in principle; opens M10a dedup.
- Scale-up = swap GKS backend, no rewrites.

**Negative**
- 2× storage until M10a — accepted at current scale.
- User must configure SC plugin to match the canonical model. Recoverable failure: agents always get correct results (GKS canonical); only Obsidian Smart View shows divergent neighbours if user picks a different model in SC — drift visible to humans, not destructive.
- M7c adds GKS as a hard runtime dep for semantic features (was Obsidian before this update). GKS is an npm package, easier to vend than a GUI app.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Bundle `@xenova/transformers` in MSP for ONNX models.** Rejected — duplicates GKS's bundle; ~100 MB install bloat; version drift.
2. **Default to Ollama BGE-M3.** Considered. Better for headless once Ollama installed, but raises the install bar (Ollama + model pull). GKS's nomic via `@huggingface/transformers` runs without Ollama.
3. **Skip semantic; do BM25 only.** Rejected — meaningfully worse retrieval; GKS already ships embeddings for free.
4. **Smart Connections as canonical (original M7-prep choice).** Rejected on audit — forces every agent recall through Obsidian; defeats headless.

## What this ADR does NOT change

- **MSP write contract** — atoms + frontmatter + crosslinks unchanged.
- **MSP validator** — doesn't care about embeddings either way.
- **GKS storage shape** — atomic markdown unchanged; only the vector backend choice.
- **Authority / promotion / hooks** — orthogonal.
