# ADR — promotion workflow

## Context

GKS exposes `proposeInbound()` as the only write-path to candidate atoms. Without a defined workflow above it, agents would either (a) skip validation, (b) self-promote without human review, or (c) re-submit endlessly without iteration. We need an explicit three-gate sequence.

## Decision

Three gates, in order, between agent draft and a `stable` atom under `gks/<type>/`:

```
draft.md ──▶ inbound queue ──▶ validator ──▶ human review ──▶ gks/<type>/
              (gate 1)         (gate 2)       (gate 3)
```

### Gate 1 — submission

- Agent calls `gks propose-inbound <ID> --title=... --body=...` (or wraps in MSP envelope per `CONCEPT--SUBMISSION-ENVELOPE`).
- File lands in `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/inbound/<ID>.rev-<reviewId>.md`.
- No automatic check yet; the agent owns the submission.

### Gate 2 — automated validation

- `npm run msp:validate -- <inbound-file>` runs the validator from `FEAT--MSP-VALIDATOR`.
- All hard rules apply: forbidden-fields, ID-format, ID-filename-match, ADR-monotonic, dangling-wikilinks, future-date, summary-min, phase-status.
- Fail → file moves to `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/rejected/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` with `rejection_reason.md`. Agent re-submits with fixes.
- Pass → file ready for human review.

### Gate 3 — human review

- Reviewer is determined by atom type — see `ADR--HUMAN-REVIEW-GATES` (TBD).
- Reviewer reads body, checks substance (the validator can't judge "is this a good ADR").
- Approve → `npx gks inbound promote <ID>` moves the file to `gks/<type>/<ID>.md` with `status: stable`.
- Reject → manual move to rejected/ with reviewer + reason.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Each gate has one job; failures localised.
- Bypass requires actively breaking the workflow (e.g. direct git push to `gks/`) — caught by pre-commit + branch protection.
- Audit log captures every transition.

**Negative**
- Three gates add latency. Typical agent-to-stable: minutes if reviewer is online; hours otherwise.
- Hotfix scenarios need the escape hatch in `ADR--HOTFIX-ESCAPE-HATCH` to skip the human gate without skipping accountability.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Two-gate (validator + auto-promote).** Rejected. Removes substance review; allows well-formed but wrong atoms.
2. **One-gate (just human).** Rejected. Reviewers waste time on trivially-broken submissions (forbidden fields, dangling links).
3. **Allow agents to direct-write to `gks/` for low-tier atoms (idea, devlog).** Considered; deferred. ADR-014 in GksV3 has the strict-vs-light tier split — could borrow that, but for MSP M-series we keep one workflow for predictability.

## What this ADR does NOT decide

- The promotion *levels* (L0/L1/L2) — see `ADR--PROMOTION-LEVELS`.
- Which reviewer for which atom — see `ADR--HUMAN-REVIEW-GATES` (TBD).
- The hotfix bypass — see `ADR--HOTFIX-ESCAPE-HATCH`.
