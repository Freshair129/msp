# ADR — Bring-your-own attributes

> Resolves decision **D-8** in `UNIVERSAL-CONTEXT-FRAMEWORK_spec.md` §0.

## Context

`CONCEPT--ATTRIBUTE-BAG-MODEL` requires that domain-specific metadata (PHI tags, PCI tags, internal-only flags) flow through the domain-agnostic core without the core hardcoding any domain enumeration. The open question is **where the attribute bag physically lives**:

1. **Extend GKS `Namespace`** — add an `attributes?: AttributeBag` field to the existing `Namespace` interface.
2. **Atom metadata** — carry attributes in atom frontmatter (`attributes:` key) and the corresponding JSON column in the pgvector / storage backends.
3. **Separate attributes table** — a normalized side table joined on atom id.

This matters because `Namespace` in GKS is a **partition key** — immutable, indexed, coarse, and load-bearing for partition-pruning queries (Layer 1 of the five-layer pipeline). Anything that touches its shape touches GKS's storage invariants and forces a pgvector schema migration.

## Decision

**Adopt option 2 — attributes live in atom metadata (frontmatter `attributes:` + JSON column). GKS `Namespace` is untouched.**

- `Namespace` stays the 4-field composite key (`tenant_id | user_id | session_id | agent_id`), immutable, indexed.
- `AttributeBag = Record<string, JsonValue>` is stored as atom metadata — in frontmatter for `.md` atoms, in a JSON column for the vector backend.
- Composite queries combine both layers: `WHERE namespace.tenant_id = $1 AND attributes->>'classification' = $2`.
- The atom validator does **not** constrain `attributes:` contents — validation is delegated to per-domain schema files (per `CONCEPT--ATTRIBUTE-BAG-MODEL`).

## Consequences

Positive:

- GKS invariants preserved: `Namespace` stays immutable, indexed, coarse. No pgvector schema migration for the partition key.
- The two filter layers stay cleanly separated: Namespace = coarse + indexed (Layer 1), attributes = fine + queryable-but-not-indexed-by-default (Layer 2).
- Attributes are mutable (re-classification, re-tagging by classifiers) without violating the "Namespace is immutable" rule.
- GKS remains publishable as a standalone library — UCF adds metadata conventions, not GKS schema changes. Respects the GKS↔MSP boundary (`ADR--MONOREPO-STRUCTURE`).

Negative / accepted costs:

- Attribute-based filters are not indexed by default. For large vaults with heavy attribute filtering, a GIN index on the JSON column may be needed later — that is an additive migration, not a breaking one.
- Two places to read when reasoning about a Resource's access profile (its Namespace and its attributes). Accepted: they answer different questions (WHERE vs WHO) and conflating them was the failure mode this ADR avoids.

## Alternatives considered

**Option 1 — extend GKS `Namespace` with `attributes`.** Rejected. It breaks the "Namespace is an immutable partition key" invariant the moment attributes become mutable (which they must be — classifiers re-tag). It forces a pgvector schema migration on the partition key. It pushes domain-shaped data into GKS, violating the storage-engine scope. The apparent upside — "one place for all metadata" — is illusory: Namespace and attributes answer different questions and should not share a home.

**Option 3 — separate attributes table.** Rejected for v1. A normalized side table is more flexible for complex attribute queries but adds a join to every Layer 2 evaluation and a second write path on every retain. Overkill while the attribute surface is small. Reconsider if attribute query patterns outgrow JSON-column filtering.

## Source

- `docs/msp/UNIVERSAL-CONTEXT-FRAMEWORK_spec.md` §0 (D-8), §4 — attribute bag storage rationale.
- `CONCEPT--ATTRIBUTE-BAG-MODEL` — the bag model this ADR places.
- `CONCEPT--NAMESPACE-VAULT-BRAIN` — why Namespace must stay a pure partition key.
- `packages/gks/src/memory/types.ts` — the `Namespace` interface left unchanged.
