# ADR — Default policy posture

> Resolves decision **D-7** in `UNIVERSAL-CONTEXT-FRAMEWORK_spec.md` §0.

## Context

When the PDP (`[[CONCEPT--ABAC-POLICY-ENGINE]]`) goes live, every entry point starts consulting it. The question is the **default effect** when no rule explicitly matches a request:

1. **`default-deny`** — secure by default; nothing is permitted unless a rule explicitly allows it.
2. **`default-permit`** — permissive by default; only explicit deny rules block anything.

`default-deny` is the textbook-correct security posture. But MSP already has working flows (recall, retain, runTask, the 20 MCP tools, the Express API) that today run with no policy layer at all. Flipping to `default-deny` on day one means **every existing flow breaks** until a permit rule is written for it. History shows that is how policy-engine rollouts get reverted and lose team trust.

## Decision

**Phased posture: `default-permit` + shadow log first, then tighten to `default-deny` per-endpoint from Phase 3 onward.**

- **Phase 1 — `default-permit` + shadow mode.** The PDP runs and logs a full reasoning trace for every request, but enforcement is off — every action proceeds regardless of the decision. The shadow log answers: *"if we flipped this endpoint to enforce, what would have been denied?"*
- **Phase 2 — author rules against the shadow log.** Operators read the would-have-denied report, write the permit rules that legitimate flows need, and fix the atoms / attributes that were mis-tagged.
- **Phase 3 onward — flip to `default-deny` per-endpoint.** One entry point at a time, starting with the lowest-risk surface (`runTask`), graduating each only when its shadow log is clean. The `expose-to-llm` action on `restricted`-tier Resources is an early target.
- **End state — `default-deny` everywhere.** The permissive default is a rollout scaffold, not the destination.

The posture is itself policy data (per `[[ADR--POLICY-AS-DATA-NOT-CODE]]`): a per-endpoint `default_effect` field, flippable without a deploy.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Zero breakage of existing flows on day one — Phase 1 changes nothing observable except the appearance of a shadow log.
- The shadow log is a **concrete artifact** for the Phase 2 conversation — operators tighten policy against real traffic, not guesses.
- Per-endpoint graduation means a bug in one endpoint's rules cannot take down the others.
- Team trust is built incrementally: each endpoint flips only after its shadow log proves the rules are right.

Negative / accepted costs:

- There is a window (Phase 1 → Phase 3 per endpoint) where the system is **not actually enforcing** — `default-permit` means an attacker is not blocked yet. Accepted and explicitly bounded: shadow mode is a rollout phase, not a resting state, and the highest-sensitivity action (`expose-to-llm` on `restricted`) is among the first to flip.
- Risk that "tighten later" never happens and the system sits in `default-permit` forever. Mitigated: each phase in spec §11 names the per-endpoint flips as explicit deliverables with acceptance criteria; `default-deny` everywhere is the stated end state, not optional.
- Two posture states to test (permit + shadow, deny + enforce) per endpoint. Accepted — both are needed regardless; the phasing just sequences them.

## Alternatives considered

**`default-deny` from Phase 1.** Rejected. Textbook-correct, operationally fatal here: every existing flow breaks simultaneously, the team cannot write all permit rules atomically, the rollout gets reverted, and the policy engine acquires a reputation as "the thing that broke prod." Correct posture, wrong moment.

**`default-permit` forever (only ever write deny rules).** Rejected. That is not access control — it is a blocklist, and blocklists fail open on everything the author did not anticipate. Acceptable as a *phase*, unacceptable as an *end state*.

**Global flip (all endpoints at once) when shadow logs are clean.** Rejected: couples the rollout of unrelated endpoints. A bad rule on the symbol API should not block tightening the recall API. Per-endpoint graduation isolates risk.

## Source

- `docs/msp/UNIVERSAL-CONTEXT-FRAMEWORK_spec.md` §0 (D-7), §11 Phase 1 / Phase 3.
- `[[CONCEPT--ABAC-POLICY-ENGINE]]` — shadow mode and the PDP this posture configures.
- `[[ADR--POLICY-AS-DATA-NOT-CODE]]` — the posture is itself a policy-data field, flippable per endpoint.
