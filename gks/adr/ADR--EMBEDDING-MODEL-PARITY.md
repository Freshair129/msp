# ADR — embedding model parity

> **Status note (validated 2026-05-04)**: GKS 3.6.0 + `createNomicEmbedder()` are **unreleased on npm** at the time of this ADR — `npm view @freshair129/gks` returns 3.5.6 latest, which exports providers `'ollama' | 'openai' | 'mock'` only (no nomic). 3.6.0 source exists on `Freshair129/GksV3` (CHANGELOG documents `createNomicEmbedder`) but has not been published. This ADR records the **target architecture once 3.6.0 ships**. Until then, MSP uses GKS 3.5.6 with `provider: 'ollama'` (BGE-M3 default) or `'mock'` for tests — see fallback section. Tracked at `upstream/gks-proposals/05-publish-3.6.0.md`.

## Context

GksV3 3.6.0 ships `createNomicEmbedder()` — a Node-side local embedder running `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` via `@huggingface/transformers`. 768-dim, Thai+English, fully local, no external service.

Smart Connections (Obsidian community plugin) lets the user pick the embedding model in a GUI dropdown — could be sentence-transformers variants, BGE, or nomic.

If GKS embeds with model A and Smart Connections embeds with model B, the **same atom is embedded twice** with **incompatible vectors** (different dimension, tokenizer, normalisation). Cost: 2× compute + 2× storage + inconsistent retrieval results across surfaces.

Worse: a query embedded by GKS cannot be used to search Smart Connections's index (and vice versa), so cross-surface retrieval is impossible without re-embedding queries through both.

`ADR--SEMANTIC-SEARCH-VIA-SMART-CONNECTIONS` (M7-prep) said "MSP delegates semantic to Smart Connections; never embeds". That's incomplete — GKS DOES embed, and we should treat its embedder as the canonical Node-side path. Smart Connections becomes the in-Obsidian browse surface.

This ADR locks the canonical model so all surfaces stay compatible.

## Decision

### Canonical embedding model

**`nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`** — 768-dimensional, 2048 token context, Thai + English mixed-content support.

This matches GKS 3.6.0's default in `createNomicEmbedder()`. Smart Connections users must configure their plugin to use the same model:

```
Obsidian Settings → Smart Connections → Embedding Model:
   nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5
```

(Smart Connections supports model selection via its GUI — see `examples/setup/smart-connections-config.md` shipped in this PR.)

### Canonical writer

**GKS** is the canonical embedder. It writes vectors to `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/vector/atomic.jsonl` (or a configured backend like pgvector / HNSW).

Smart Connections may build its own index in `.smart-connections/` — that's used **only for human browsing inside Obsidian** (Smart View pane, etc.). MSP's agent-facing retrieval (`msp_recall` in M7c) queries GKS's vector store, not Smart Connections's.

### Why two indexes if model is the same

Pragmatically:
- GKS persists vectors in JSONL/HNSW/pgvector via its `VectorBackend` interface.
- Smart Connections persists in `.smart-connections/` with its own schema (which is plugin-version-specific and not stable to read from outside).
- Reading Smart Connections's storage from MSP would couple MSP to plugin internals — fragile.

Until the M10a "msp-bridge" companion plugin lands (Smart Connections reads GKS's store directly), we accept the 2× storage cost as the price of plugin-isolation. Compute cost is borne once per atom-change × 2 surfaces, which is small at typical vault size (< 5,000 atoms).

### Migration path if model changes

- New model selection requires `npm run re-embed` (GKS-provided) + Smart Connections re-index (plugin-managed).
- Bumping this ADR's canonical model = `update_atomic` proposal with semver bump (minor for compatible model swap, major for dimension change).
- During migration, both old and new vectors may coexist briefly — recall results are valid only on the new model post-cutover.

### What if user wants a different model

Allowed but documented as a deviation. Update `MSP_EMBEDDER_MODEL` env var (or GKS config) **and** Smart Connections plugin setting. Project-local ADR records the deviation. MSP doesn't enforce the canonical model — but defaults to it.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Single conceptual model across surfaces — no "which embedder did this?" ambiguity.
- Vectors interchangeable in principle (same model + tokenizer + normalisation) — opens future M10a optimisation where Smart Connections reads GKS's store.
- Thai content support out of the box (nomic-embed-text-v1.5 has explicit multilingual training).
- No external API keys required — fully local default (privacy + cost win).

**Negative**
- ~2× compute + storage until M10a — accepted at current scale.
- User must configure Smart Connections manually. Recoverable failure: if user picks a different model in SC, agents still get correct results from GKS (canonical), only Obsidian's Smart View shows divergent neighbours. Drift visible to humans, not destructive.
- Locks the project to a 768-dim space — moving to higher-dim models requires migration. Acceptable; nomic v1.5 is a reasonable medium-term anchor.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Each surface picks its own model.** Rejected — inconsistent retrieval, 2× embed work with no compatibility upside.
2. **MSP ships its own embedder (e.g. bundle `transformers.js`).** Rejected — duplicates GKS's bundle; ~100 MB install bloat; version drift.
3. **Use Ollama BGE-M3 as canonical (the GKS 3.5.x default).** Rejected — Ollama is an extra install requirement; nomic via Node-side `@huggingface/transformers` runs without Ollama.
4. **Use OpenAI text-embedding-3-small.** Rejected — sends content to API; not local; cost.

## Fallback while GKS 3.6.0 is unpublished

Until `@freshair129/gks@3.6.0` lands on npm:

| Path | Today (3.5.6) | After 3.6.0 publish |
|---|---|---|
| Agent-facing semantic recall | `provider: 'ollama'` (BGE-M3, requires Ollama install) **or** `provider: 'mock'` (tests / dev) | `createNomicEmbedder()` (no Ollama needed) |
| Smart Connections in Obsidian | configure to match GKS provider — if GKS uses Ollama BGE-M3, set Smart Connections to BGE-M3 | switch both to `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` |
| Vector dimension | depends on Ollama model (typical 1024 for BGE-M3) | 768 (nomic) |

When 3.6.0 publishes:
1. `npm install @freshair129/gks@^3.6.0` (already covered by `^3.5.6` semver — auto-picks)
2. Run `npm run gks re-embed` to migrate vectors from old model to nomic
3. User reconfigures Smart Connections to match
4. This ADR's "Status note" is removed via `update_atomic`

## What this ADR does NOT change

- `ADR--SEMANTIC-SEARCH-VIA-SMART-CONNECTIONS` framing about Smart Connections being the in-Obsidian path remains valid — but **Smart Connections is no longer the canonical writer** (once 3.6.0 ships). That ADR gets clarified in this PR.
- GKS upstream patch for backlinks API / phase 6 — separate concerns.
- M7c retrieval orchestration design — primary semantic source switches to GKS vector store; Smart Connections probe becomes secondary.
