# ADR — pre-commit hook implementation shape

## Context

A pre-commit hook can be implemented as:
1. **Bash script** copied into `.git/hooks/pre-commit` by the user.
2. **husky / simple-git-hooks** managed by `package.json` (`"prepare": "husky install"`).
3. **A node script** invoked by a thin bash shim.
4. **Lefthook / pre-commit (the Python tool)** managed by a YAML config.

Each has trade-offs around portability, install friction, and dep weight.

## Decision

**Plain bash script under `examples/hooks/pre-commit-validator.sh`**, opt-in install via a one-line copy or via `examples/hooks/install.sh`. No new runtime dependencies on `package.json`.

### Why bash, not husky

- **Zero new dependencies.** husky pulls in itself (~5 KB) but more importantly creates an opinion about hook management (the `husky/_/` shim, lifecycle scripts in `package.json`). For a single hook on a small repo, that's overkill.
- **Portability.** Bash hooks work identically on Linux, macOS, and Git Bash on Windows. node-based hook would need `node` on PATH at hook time which is usually true but adds a startup latency we can avoid for the no-files-staged early-exit path.
- **Discoverability.** A bash script under `examples/hooks/` is grep-able and reviewable in a single `cat`. husky obscures the actual hook behind framework layers.
- **Skip path uses standard `--no-verify`** — the ADR-level decision that we never invent a custom skip flag.

### Algorithm

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# 1. List staged .md files matching the patterns we care about.
staged=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | \
         grep -E '^(gks/.*\.md|\.brain/msp/projects/[^/]+/inbound/.*\.md)$' || true)

# 2. Early exit if none staged.
[ -z "$staged" ] && exit 0

# 3. Run validator on each. Accumulate failures.
fail=0
while IFS= read -r f; do
  if ! npm run msp:validate --silent -- "$f" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    fail=$((fail + 1))
    npm run msp:validate --silent -- "$f" 2>&1 | sed "s/^/  /"
  fi
done <<< "$staged"

# 4. Exit accordingly.
if [ "$fail" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "✗ MSP validator: $fail file(s) failed. Fix and re-stage, or use --no-verify to skip."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ MSP validator: $(echo "$staged" | wc -l) file(s) passed."
```

### Install paths

Two options documented in `examples/hooks/README.md`:

```sh
# Option A — manual (most explicit)
cp examples/hooks/pre-commit-validator.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Option B — install script (idempotent; refuses if a non-MSP hook already exists)
bash examples/hooks/install.sh
```

`install.sh` writes a small marker comment so re-runs are idempotent and so it can detect hooks installed by other tools without overwriting them.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Zero new dependencies on `package.json`.
- Works identically across platforms supporting Git Bash.
- The script is the documentation — anyone can `cat` it and understand the contract.
- Validator's existing exit-code contract (0 pass / 1 hard / 2 internal) translates 1:1.

**Negative**
- Each developer must install the hook manually. Mitigated by a one-line install helper + a README badge.
- No automatic enforcement on Windows users without Git Bash. Acceptable — they get CI as a fallback.

## Alternatives considered

1. **husky.** Rejected per dep weight + opinion overhead.
2. **simple-git-hooks.** Lighter than husky but still adds `package.json` config. Bash + opt-in is even simpler.
3. **Pre-push hook instead of pre-commit.** Rejected — pre-commit blocks bad work earlier; pre-push lets the commit land then surprises you at push time.
4. **Run the validator from inside the hook via `node` directly (skipping `npm`).** Considered. Faster startup (~50ms) but couples the hook to an absolute path. `npm run msp:validate` lets `package.json` indirect the runner.
