# AUDIT - UCF Phase 3: Vaults & Resolution Gradient

## Scope

This audit covers Phase 3 of the Universal Context Framework (UCF).
The goals were to implement multi-namespace views (Vaults) and a tiered
retrieval model (Resolution Gradient) to optimize context window usage.

## What shipped

- **Vault Registry:** Implemented `Vault` data model and registry in `packages/msp/src/vault/`. Supports `read_from` OR-union of Namespaces.
- **Resolution Gradient:** Implemented Layer 4 (Tiering) and Layer 5 (Budget) in the context pipeline. Top hits return `FULL` body; others return `MENTION` (ID only).
- **Expand Verb:** Implemented `expand()` facade method and `msp_expand` MCP tool. Successfully re-runs ABAC (PEP) before exposing full bodies.
- **Default-Deny Flip:** Authored `policies/20-restricted-expose.yaml`. The `expose-to-llm` action is now `default-deny` for `restricted` resources.
- **Vault CLI:** Shipped `msp-vault` tool for registry management and visibility checks.
- **Token Efficiency:** Verified **76.8% token reduction** on standard query sets using the 2-tier MVP resolution.
- **GKS Alignment:** Updated GKS `GraphBackend` interface and tests to be consistently asynchronous.

## Verification

- **Benchmark:** Ran `bench-ucf-resolution.ts` (76.8% reduction confirmed).
- **Policy:** Verified `default-deny` flip via shadow logs and test cases.
- **Type Safety:** Monorepo-wide `typecheck` is clean.
- **Integrity:** `msp:validate` passes with 327 atoms.

## Sign-off

- Implemented by: Gemini CLI
- Verified by: Benchmark + typecheck + logic tests
- Date: 2026-05-14
