# AUDIT — MCP cwd resolution fix

## Problem (surfaced 2026-05-07 via `[[AUDIT--GKS-UPSTREAM-PROPOSALS-FILED]]`)

When Claude Desktop launches the MSP MCP server with the canonical config —

```json
"command": "node",
"args": ["G:\\msp\\dist\\mcp\\bin.js", "--root=G:\\msp"]
```

— `process.cwd()` is `C:\Windows\system32` (Claude Desktop's working dir), not `G:\msp`. Calls to `msp_propose` and `msp_validate` failed with paths resolved off the wrong root:

```
msp_propose:  Cannot find module 'C:\Windows\system32\scripts\msp\propose.mjs'
msp_validate: atomic index not found at C:\Windows\system32\gks\00_index\atomic_index.jsonl
```

## Root cause

`src/mcp/bin.ts` was calling `createMspMcpServer()` with no arguments. The factory in `src/mcp/server.ts` had this fallback chain:

```ts
const root = opts.root ?? process.env.MSP_ROOT ?? process.cwd()
```

Without `opts.root`, and Claude Desktop not setting `MSP_ROOT` in env, it landed on `cwd`.

The `--root=G:\msp` flag in `process.argv` was **never parsed**. Individual tool handlers (`propose.ts`, `validate.ts`, etc.) all already read `ctx.root` correctly — the bug was purely at the wiring layer between argv and the factory.

## Fix

Two-line conceptual fix, three files in practice:

1. **`src/mcp/argv.ts`** (new) — exports `parseRootFromArgv(argv)`:
   - Handles both `--root=<path>` and `--root <path>` forms
   - Empty values treated as missing (not as empty string)
   - First occurrence wins (CLI norm)
   - Strict prefix match (`--rootless` doesn't trigger)

2. **`src/mcp/bin.ts`** — parse argv before constructing the server:
   ```ts
   const root = parseRootFromArgv(process.argv.slice(2))
   const server = createMspMcpServer({ root })
   ```

3. **`src/mcp/server.ts`** — unchanged. The existing `opts.root ?? MSP_ROOT ?? cwd` chain still works; `bin.ts` now feeds it the parsed value.

## Tests added

- **`test/mcp/argv.test.ts`** (8 unit tests) — covers all forms, edge cases (empty, trailing, mixed args, prefix collisions)
- **`test/mcp/bin.test.ts`** — added regression test `uses --root=<path> argv flag when cwd is unrelated and MSP_ROOT is unset`. Spawns the bin from `os.tmpdir()` with a clean env (no `MSP_ROOT`), passes `--root=<repo>`, calls `msp_validate {all:true}`, asserts the response is well-formed JSON with `ok: boolean` and contains no `atomic index unreadable` / `C:\Windows\system32` strings.

The bin.test.ts spawn helper was also generalised — prefers `node dist/mcp/bin.js` when a build exists (works on Windows + Linux without depending on `npx` PATH resolution), falls back to `npx tsx src/mcp/bin.ts`.

## Verification

```bash
# Unit
npx vitest run test/mcp/argv.test.ts        # 8/8 pass

# Integration (post-build)
npm run build
npx vitest run test/mcp/bin.test.ts          # 2/2 pass
                                              # — initialize + tools/list (existing)
                                              # — --root from unrelated cwd (new regression)

# Live e2e from a non-repo cwd
cd $env:TEMP
echo '{...initialize...}\n{...tools/call msp_validate...}' | node G:\msp\dist\mcp\bin.js --root=G:\msp
# → {"ok":true, "results":[161 atoms, all empty errors]}
```

## Pre-existing flakes (NOT caused by this fix)

Full `npm test` shows 11 failures / 533+ passed. All are environmental Windows flakes documented in CLAUDE.md:

- `test/identity/store.test.ts` — Linux path strings hardcoded (`/home/user/...`); Windows resolves to `G:\home\user\...`
- `test/validator/cli.test.ts`, `test/scripts/propose.test.ts` — `spawn npx ENOENT` (Windows .cmd resolution; works in CI under `npm ci`)
- `test/hooks/*.test.ts` — `spawn chmod ENOENT` (no chmod on Windows)
- `test/codegen/acceptance/vitest.test.ts` — sandbox `EPERM` symlink to `node_modules`

Confirmed by stashing this branch's changes and re-running `bin.test.ts` on master — same `npx ENOENT`.

## Side benefits

The bin.test.ts refactor (prefer dist over npx) means the existing `tools/list` regression test now runs on Windows too, after a `npm run build`. Previously only CI could exercise it.

## Counts

- Atoms in `gks/`: +1 (this audit)
- Files changed: 4 (`argv.ts` new, `bin.ts` rewritten, `bin.test.ts` extended, `argv.test.ts` new)
- LOC added: ~85 (function + 8 unit tests + 1 integration test + spawn helper refactor)
- LOC removed: ~3
- Behaviour change: end-user — none beyond bug fix; API surface — none changed

## Why no separate CONCEPT/ADR/FEAT/BLUEPRINT chain

This is a P5 bug fix on existing implementation, not a new design decision. CLAUDE.md's doc-to-code workflow says "Phase 4 (TASK) is for orchestrator handoff — usually skipped for single-developer slices" — same logic applies for one-line bug fixes. The implemented behaviour was already specified in `[[BLUEPRINT--MSP-MCP-SERVER]]` (server reads root from configured options); we just made the wiring honour it.
