# AUDIT — Phase D Agentic Runtime — implementation complete

## 1. Summary

Phase D of `[[ULTRAPLAN--AGENTIC-MONOREPO-PIVOT]]` is complete. The cognitive_system monorepo now has a working agent dispatcher (Stream C), a Two-Brain resolver (Stream A/B), and a meta-learning entry point (Stream D). Seven feature PRs landed, plus a closeout PR for the loose ends.

## 2. What shipped

### 2.1 PRs

| PR | Stream | Subject |
|---|---|---|
| #103 | A | PROTO predicates (incl. `[[PROTO--SCALE-LEVEL-GATE]]`) |
| #104 | D | atom-templates skill, skill-creator scaffold, MLL pipeline stub |
| #107, #108 | C | Dispatcher P1 — tier router + cost policy |
| #109, #110 | C | Dispatcher P2 — T1/T2/T3 tier adapters |
| #111, #112 | C | Dispatcher P3 — escalation engine + budgets |
| #113, #114 | C | Dispatcher P4 — `dispatch()` end-to-end + `result-recorder` |
| #115, #116 | A/B | Two-Brain resolver + `~/.brain/` init script + MCP tool |
| #XXX | closeout | EPISODE SPEC + contract bump + this audit |

### 2.2 Working features

- **`dispatch(task)`** — end-to-end agent dispatch with tier selection, escalation, and best-effort episode recording.
- **`npx msp-dispatch`** — CLI entry point over `dispatch()`; accepts a prompt and prints the chosen tier's output.
- **`resolve(query)`** — Two-Brain resolver: deterministic per-atom-type routing between `~/.brain/` (global) and `<repo>/gks/` (project), per `[[ADR--BRAIN-PATH-RESOLUTION]]`.
- **`msp_brain_resolve`** MCP tool — exposes the resolver to MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).
- **`~/.brain/` init script** — `scripts/msp/init-brain.mjs` provisions the global brain directory layout and migrates from the legacy `~/.msp/` location.
- **`scale_level` on 22 BLUEPRINTs** — frontmatter field added so `[[PROTO--SCALE-LEVEL-GATE]]` can route work-items by scale (atom / package / monorepo).

### 2.3 Contract / atom additions

- `[[SPEC--EPISODE-ATOM]]` (this PR) — documents the runtime-generated episode contract.
- `msp/LLM_Contract/atomic_contract.yaml` gains an `episode:` entry under `required_fields.by_type` so episodes written by `result-recorder.ts` pass `msp:validate`.
- This audit atom.

## 3. Known follow-ups

- **Episode storage location contradiction** between `[[ADR--BRAIN-PATH-RESOLUTION]]` (global-only) and `result-recorder.ts` (writes to project `gks/episode/`). Documented in `[[SPEC--EPISODE-ATOM]]` §7; resolution deferred to Phase E.
- Several Stream D pieces (skill-creator full pipeline, MLL closed loop) are scaffolded but not yet end-to-end.

## 4. Deferred to Phase E

See `ROADMAP.md` for the full list. Phase E focuses on closing the MLL loop, hardening cost budgets, and resolving the episode-storage contradiction above.

## 5. Verification

- `npm run msp:validate` green at audit time.
- `npm run msp:check-links` green at audit time.
- `npm run test` and `npm run typecheck` green on Node 20 + 22.

## 6. Closeout sign-off

Phase D is closed. Phase E may begin. The agentic monorepo pivot's foundational runtime is now in place: an agent driving this repo via Claude Code (or any MCP client) can dispatch tasks, resolve memory across two brains, and leave an audit trail behind.
