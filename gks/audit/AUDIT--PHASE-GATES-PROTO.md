# M8b — PROTO--PHASE-GATES (draft)

## Scope

Implements `CONCEPT--PROTO-PHASE-GATES` as a PROTO predicate plugged into
the M8a loader. Mechanises the doc-to-code phase order from
`FRAME--PHASE-GOVERNANCE`.

## What shipped

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/validator/proto/phase-gates.ts` | Predicate impl (default export) |
| `gks/proto/PROTO--PHASE-GATES.md` | PROTO atom — `status: draft`, `severity: error`, enforces FRAME--PHASE-GOVERNANCE |
| `test/validator/proto/phase-gates.test.ts` | 9 tests covering the predicate |
| `gks/audit/AUDIT--PHASE-GATES-PROTO.md` | This file |

## Rule (per CONCEPT--PROTO-PHASE-GATES)

1. **Hard error** — every phase-5 / phase-6 atom (FEAT or AUDIT) that
   writes code via `linked_symbols` must be preceded by a phase-3
   BLUEPRINT atom whose `linked_symbols` covers at least one of the same
   files.
2. **Soft warning** — phase-2 ADR atoms with no phase-1 CONCEPT
   referenced via `crosslinks.references`.

## Escape hatch

Atoms can opt out of the BLUEPRINT requirement via frontmatter:

```yaml
phase_override:
  skip_blueprint: true
  reason: "out-of-scope code under examples/, hooks/, internal scripts"
```

The predicate reads each candidate's atom file from disk to inspect this
field (it's not present in `atomic_index.jsonl`).

## Ships as draft

`status: draft` in the PROTO atom means even `severity: error` violations
do **not** fail-exit (per the M8a loader's `shouldFailExit` rule). On the
real repo, the predicate currently flags:

- 3 phase-6 AUDIT atoms whose `linked_symbols` point to files outside
  the BLUEPRINT-covered set (msp_spec.md, scripts/msp/propose.mjs +
  test/scripts/propose.test.ts, .github/workflows/test.yml)
- 5 phase-2 ADRs that reference no CONCEPT-- via `crosslinks.references`
  (soft warnings)

These are surfaced for review but don't block CI. Promotion to
`status: stable` requires either adding the missing BLUEPRINTs or
opting out via `phase_override.skip_blueprint`.

## Decisions during impl

1. **Predicate reads disk for `phase_override`** — the AtomicIndexEntry
   shape doesn't carry `phase_override`. Reading the atom file is an
   acceptable cost (only the violators are read; healthy atoms never
   trigger disk I/O).

2. **Phase 5 OR 6 + type FEAT or AUDIT** — `CONCEPT--PROTO-PHASE-GATES`
   says "phase-5 atom (FEAT/AUDIT writing code)"; the prompt explicitly
   includes phase-6 AUDITs. In this repo FEATs sit at phase 2 and AUDITs
   at 5/6 — the predicate handles both.

3. **Coverage = "≥1 file in common"** — a BLUEPRINT can cover an AUDIT
   even if the AUDIT lists more `linked_symbols` (e.g. tests added
   later). The AUDIT just needs *some* overlap with a BLUEPRINT. This
   matches the spirit of CONCEPT--PROTO-PHASE-GATES ("a phase-3
   BLUEPRINT atom whose linked_symbols includes X").

4. **Soft-warning ADR check** — only inspects `crosslinks.references`,
   not `crosslinks.implements` etc. ADRs typically decide on a CONCEPT
   via `references`.

5. **No new runtime deps** — uses `yaml` (already a dep) and
   `node:fs/promises`.

## Acceptance criteria from prompt

- [x] Pass when every code-writing phase-5 atom has a backing phase-3 BLUEPRINT (test #3)
- [x] Fail when a phase-5 FEAT's linked_symbols isn't covered (test #4)
- [x] Honour `skip_blueprint` override (test #5)
- [x] Soft warning when ADR has no CONCEPT (test #6)
- [x] No phase-5 atoms → vacuously pass (test #2)
- [x] Empty atomicIndex → vacuously pass (test #1)
- [x] Plus 3 extra: ADR with CONCEPT passes, no linked_symbols ignored, multiple violators flagged independently

## Verification

- `npm test` → **507 passed** (was 498; +9 from new tests)
- `npm run typecheck` → clean
- `npx tsx src/validator/cli.ts --all` → 145/145 atoms pass; PROTO summary shows 1 passed (sample) + 1 failed (phase-gates draft, doesn't fail-exit); exits 0
- `npm run msp:check-links` → OK

## Counts

- Atoms 144 → 145 (+1: PROTO--PHASE-GATES) → 146 (+1: this AUDIT)
- Tests 498 → 507 (+9)
