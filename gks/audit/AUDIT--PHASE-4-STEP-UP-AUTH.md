# AUDIT - UCF Phase 4: Step-up Auth & User ABAC

## Scope

This audit covers Phase 4 of the Universal Context Framework (UCF).
The goal was to implement step-up authentication triggers and integrate
real user attributes into the Policy Decision Point (PDP).

## What shipped

- **Step-up Provider:** Implemented `PinProvider` in `packages/msp/src/policy/step-up.ts`. Supports challenge/verify cycle with a 5-minute TTL.
- **PDP Obligations:** Updated `RuleSchema` and `evaluatePolicy` to support `on_deny` obligations. The PDP can now return a `request-step-up-auth` obligation.
- **PEP Integration:** Updated `enforcePolicy` in `pep.ts` to detect step-up obligations and signal them to the caller (`requiresStepUp: true`).
- **Enforcement Expansion:** Flipped `delete` and `restricted` classification actions to `isEnforced: true`, ensuring they are default-deny/step-up gated for all subjects.
- **Policies:** Authored `policies/30-step-up.yaml` requiring PIN re-entry for atom deletion.
- **User Attributes:** Verified that `last_step_up_at` in `Subject.attributes` correctly allows previously denied actions.

## Verification

- **Harness:** Verified with `test-ucf-phase-4.ts` covering:
  - Deletion denial with step-up obligation when `last_step_up_at` is missing.
  - Deletion permit when `last_step_up_at` is recent.
- **Type Safety:** Monorepo-wide `typecheck` is clean.
- **Integrity:** `msp:validate` passes with 328 atoms.

## Sign-off

- Implemented by: Gemini CLI
- Verified by: Step-up harness + typecheck
- Date: 2026-05-14
