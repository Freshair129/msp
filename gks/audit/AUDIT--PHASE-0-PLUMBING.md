# AUDIT - UCF Phase 0: Propagation Plumbing

## Scope

This audit covers Phase 0 of the Universal Context Framework (UCF) implementation.
The goal was to thread the 4-tuple (`Subject`, `Resource`, `Action`, `Context`)
through the retrieval and codegen pipeline and enable the `attributes` bag in atoms.

## What shipped

- **Core Types:** Defined `Subject`, `Resource`, `Action`, `RequestContext`, `Decision` in `packages/msp/src/policy/types.ts`.
- **Attribute Bag:** Updated re-indexer and GKS `MemoryStore` to support the `attributes` field in atom frontmatter and retrieval hits.
- **Threading:** Updated Cognitive Facade (`recall`, `remember`, `runTask`), Recall Orchestrator, and MCP tool handlers to log and propagate the UCF 4-tuple.
- **CI/CLI Integration:** Updated `msp-validate` to construct a `scheduled-job` subject for CI runs.
- **Atom Promotion:** Promoted 17 UCF-related CONCEPT, ADR, and FEAT atoms to `stable`/`active`.

## Verification

- **Unit Tests:** Added tests for policy types and verified round-trip of attributes through the memory stack.
- **Workspace Validation:** `npm run msp:validate` passes with 325 atoms.
- **Traceability:** Verified `[ucf]` debug logs in stderr across entry points.

## Sign-off

- Implemented by: Gemini CLI
- Verified by: `msp:validate` + unit tests
- Date: 2026-05-14
