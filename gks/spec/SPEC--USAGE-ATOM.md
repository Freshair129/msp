# SPEC — Usage Atom

## 1. What is a usage atom

A **usage atom** is a runtime artefact written by `packages/msp/src/agents/usage-recorder.ts` after every `dispatch(task)` call. Each usage atom is a daily bucket — one file per (vault, ISO date) — capturing:

- total `cost_usd` across all dispatches that day,
- per-tier call counts and per-tier cost subtotals,
- the top-N most-expensive episodes (by `EPISODE--AGENT-RUN-*` id reference),
- last-updated timestamp.

Where `SPEC--EPISODE-ATOM` is per-call evidence, USAGE atoms are per-day aggregate. They are the readout layer for `ADR--AGENT-TIER-COST-POLICY` enforcement.

## 2. Id pattern

```
USAGE--<bucket>-<isoDate>
```

Bucket is currently `DAILY`; the SPEC reserves room for `HOURLY` / `WEEKLY` buckets without re-versioning. `<isoDate>` is `YYYY-MM-DD` (UTC date the bucket covers).

Example:

```
USAGE--DAILY-2026-05-14
```

The id is unique per (bucket, date) — exactly one atom per day per vault.

## 3. Required frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | `USAGE--<bucket>-<isoDate>` |
| `phase` | yes | `5` (runtime / code phase per `gks/concept/CONCEPT--TAXONOMY-V2-3.md`) |
| `type` | yes | `usage` |
| `status` | yes | `stable` (see §5 — body is rewritten, frontmatter is not) |
| `vault_id` | yes | `default` (or project-specific if scoped) |
| `tier` | yes | `genesis` |
| `source_type` | yes | `episodic` |
| `title` | yes | Human-readable summary, e.g. `USAGE — Daily cost bucket 2026-05-14` |
| `tags` | yes | `[agents, usage, cost, <bucket_lowercase>]` |
| `created_at` | yes | ISO 8601 UTC of the first dispatch that opened the bucket |

### Optional fields

| Field | When | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `updated_at` | always (best practice) | ISO 8601 UTC of the most recent recorded dispatch |
| `total_cost_usd` | always (best practice) | rolling sum across all dispatches in the bucket |
| `call_count` | always (best practice) | rolling count of dispatches in the bucket |

## 4. Body contract

The body MUST contain a fenced `json` summary block delimited by HTML comment markers so it can be parsed and rewritten safely:

```
<!-- USAGE-SUMMARY-START -->
```json
{
  "total_cost_usd": 0.0234,
  "call_count": 12,
  "by_tier": {
    "T1": { "count": 8, "cost_usd": 0 },
    "T2": { "count": 3, "cost_usd": 0.0034 },
    "T3": { "count": 1, "cost_usd": 0.02 }
  },
  "top_episodes": [
    { "id": "EPISODE--AGENT-RUN-2026-05-14T03-00-00-000Z", "cost_usd": 0.02, "tier": "T3" }
  ],
  "updated_at": "2026-05-14T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```
<!-- USAGE-SUMMARY-END -->

The body MAY include human-readable headers and prose around the summary block, but the markers MUST appear exactly once. The recorder parses everything between them as JSON.

## 5. Lifecycle

USAGE atoms have a **two-phase lifecycle**:

1. **Open** (first dispatch of the day): file does not exist, recorder creates it with full frontmatter + empty summary + first call's data.
2. **Append** (subsequent dispatches): recorder reads the JSON block, mutates totals + counts + top-N list, rewrites the JSON block in place. Frontmatter is **not** touched after open (except optional `updated_at` if present).

After UTC midnight the next dispatch opens a new bucket. The previous day's USAGE atom becomes immutable de-facto — though there is no enforcement; the recorder only ever touches today's date.

USAGE atoms MAY be **purged** in bulk under a retention policy (out of scope for this SPEC — see future `SPEC--USAGE-RETENTION`).

## 6. Storage location

Usage atoms are project-scoped. The canonical write target is:

```
<root>/gks/usage/USAGE--DAILY-<isoDate>.md
```

Where `<root>` is the dispatcher's invocation root (typically `process.cwd()` at dispatch time). This mirrors `EPISODE--AGENT-RUN-*`'s current project-local location (see `SPEC--EPISODE-ATOM` §7 — the same ADR-vs-impl tension applies to USAGE; we follow current impl).

## 7. Validation

`msp/LLM_Contract/atomic_contract.yaml` declares per-type required fields for `usage`. The validator (`packages/msp/src/validator/cli.ts`) loads that contract and enforces §3 above. Body-content checks (§4 JSON markers) are not yet machine-enforced and rely on the recorder writing well-formed output.

## 8. Out of scope

- Retention policy / garbage collection.
- Cross-machine roll-up (a future `USAGE--MONTHLY` could aggregate dailies).
- Real-time cost streaming (a writer of USAGE atoms is best-effort; readers must tolerate up-to-one-call lag).
- Per-vault budget alerts — that's the cost-policy layer's job, not this SPEC's.
