# SPEC — Episode Atom

## 1. What is an episode

An **episode atom** is a runtime artefact written by `packages/msp/src/agents/result-recorder.ts` after every `dispatch(task)` call. Each episode is a markdown atom that captures, for one dispatcher invocation:

- the input `task` (prompt, type, severity, optional context size),
- the resolved `result` (output, tier_used, optional escalated_from),
- runtime metadata (duration_ms, optional cost_usd),
- a UTC `created_at` timestamp.

Episodes are the dispatcher's audit trail. They feed (eventually) into the Meta-Learning Loop's reverse path (`SPEC--META-LEARNING-LOOP` §1.1: Code → AST → Symbol Graph → **Execution Trace**) and are the primary source of evidence that a dispatch actually happened.

## 2. Id pattern

```
EPISODE--AGENT-RUN-<isoTimestamp>
```

Where `<isoTimestamp>` is the result of `new Date().toISOString()` with `:` and `.` replaced by `-` (Windows-safe filename). Example:

```
EPISODE--AGENT-RUN-2026-05-14T03-00-00-000Z
```

The id is unique per dispatch (millisecond precision plus the timestamp encoding makes collisions practically impossible within a single agent).

## 3. Required frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | `EPISODE--AGENT-RUN-<isoTimestamp>` |
| `phase` | yes | `5` (runtime / code phase per `gks/concept/CONCEPT--TAXONOMY-V2-3.md`) |
| `type` | yes | `episode` |
| `status` | yes | `stable` (episodes are immutable on creation — see §5) |
| `vault_id` | yes | `default` (or project-specific if scoped) |
| `tier` | yes | `genesis` |
| `source_type` | yes | `episodic` |
| `title` | yes | Human-readable summary, e.g. `EPISODE — Agent run <stamp> (<tier>)` |
| `tags` | yes | `[agents, dispatch, <tier_lowercase>]` |
| `created_at` | yes | ISO 8601 UTC (`Z` suffix is acceptable for episodes since they are machine-generated) |

### Optional fields

| Field | When | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `cost_usd` | tier returned a cost figure | `number` |
| `duration_ms` | always (best practice) | `number` |
| `escalated_from` | dispatcher escalated mid-run | tier name (e.g. `T1`) |

## 4. Body contract

The body MUST include the following sections (in any order):

- **Prompt** (full text, in a fenced code block) — the unmodified `task.prompt`.
- **Output** (full text, in a fenced code block) — the unmodified `result.output`.
- **Metadata bullets** — at minimum `tier_used`, `duration_ms`, `task.type`, `task.severity`.

It MAY include:

- a truncated prompt snippet in the header for human scanability,
- `stderr` if the underlying tier produced one,
- `escalated_from` notes when relevant.

`result-recorder.ts` is the canonical producer; downstream consumers (MLL, recall) parse the body but do not rewrite it.

## 5. Lifecycle

Episodes are **immutable**. Once written, they are never edited, superseded, or status-flipped. This is by design — they are evidence, not opinion.

- **No `supersedes` / `superseded_by` crosslinks** are permitted between episodes.
- **No status transition** from `stable` is ever performed.
- Episodes MAY be **purged** in bulk under a retention policy (out of scope for this SPEC — see future `SPEC--EPISODE-RETENTION`).

This contrasts with `ADR`, `CONCEPT`, etc., which can be superseded — for those, the contradiction-detection layer applies. For episodes it does not.

## 6. Storage location

Per `ADR--BRAIN-PATH-RESOLUTION` §Routing table (as amended 2026-05-14), `EPISODE` atoms are **project-only**: read from and written to `<root>/gks/episode/`. An episode records a task run against *this* repo — it is project-scoped state, the reverse-path evidence the Meta-Learning Loop consumes.

The canonical write target is therefore:

```
<root>/gks/episode/EPISODE--AGENT-RUN-<isoTimestamp>.md
```

Episodes garbage-collected under the Phase F4 retention policy (`ADR--EPISODE-GC-POLICY`) are moved to `<root>/gks/episode/_archive/<YYYY-MM>/`.

## 7. Resolution — impl/ADR contradiction (closed 2026-05-14)

This section originally flagged a contradiction: `result-recorder.ts` wrote episodes to `<root>/gks/episode/` while `ADR--BRAIN-PATH-RESOLUTION` listed `EPISODE` as global-only.

**Resolved in favour of option 2 — ADR follows impl.** The Phase D runtime (`result-recorder.ts`), the Phase D integration test, and the Phase F4 GC (`episode-gc.ts`) had all independently treated episodes as project-local; three phases of implementation agreed. `ADR--BRAIN-PATH-RESOLUTION` was amended to route `EPISODE` to project-only, and the brain routing table (`packages/msp/src/brain/routing-table.ts`), `global-vault.ts`, and `project-vault.ts` were updated to match. `result-recorder.ts` was already correct and is unchanged.

## 8. Validation

`msp/LLM_Contract/atomic_contract.yaml` declares the per-type required fields for `episode`. The validator (`packages/msp/src/validator/cli.ts`) loads that contract and enforces §3 above. Body-content checks (§4) are not yet machine-enforced and rely on the recorder writing well-formed output.

## 9. Out of scope

- Retention policy / garbage collection — shipped in Phase F4; see `ADR--EPISODE-GC-POLICY`.
- Episode compression into longer-form `SUMMARY--` atoms (handled by `packages/msp/src/orchestrator/consolidator/`).
- Cross-machine sync of the project brain's run history.
- Encryption at rest of episode bodies (may contain sensitive prompts).
