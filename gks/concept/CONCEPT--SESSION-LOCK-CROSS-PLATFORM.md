# CONCEPT — session lock cross-platform parity

## Problem

`src/memory/sessions/lock.ts` implements an advisory lockfile for session writes:

- Open `.lock` with `O_EXCL` create
- Write the holder's PID
- On lock contention, check if holder PID is still alive via `process.kill(pid, 0)`
- Stale (dead PID) → remove and acquire

This works on POSIX. On Windows the picture is rougher:

1. **Zombie PIDs** — `process.kill(pid, 0)` may return alive for processes that are technically dead but still have an entry in the kernel's process table (Windows holds these longer than POSIX in some cases)
2. **Antivirus / Search Indexer file locks** — third-party tools can keep handles open on `.lock` files briefly, breaking exclusive create
3. **Network filesystems** (Samba, OneDrive) — exclusive create semantics weaker; may permit two processes to "create" the same lockfile in rare race windows
4. **Crashed Node before write** — process exits between `open('wx')` and `write(pid)`. Resulting empty lockfile is correctly treated as stale, but the window is wider on Windows due to slower IO

The impl handles (4) already (empty file → NaN → stale). It does NOT handle (1), (2), (3).

## What M9f adds

A **max-age safeguard**: if a lockfile's mtime is older than a threshold (default 5 minutes), it's considered stale regardless of PID-liveness. Defends against zombie PIDs + crashes that left a populated-but-orphan lockfile.

```ts
export async function acquire(lockPath: string, opts: { maxAgeMs?: number } = {}): Promise<LockHandle> {
  const maxAgeMs = opts.maxAgeMs ?? 5 * 60 * 1000  // 5 min default
  // ... existing logic with one extra check before the PID-liveness one:
  //   const stat = await fs.stat(lockPath)
  //   if (now - stat.mtimeMs > maxAgeMs) → stale, remove + retry
}
```

Also: when writing the PID, also write the timestamp:

```
<pid>\n<iso timestamp>\n
```

This is forward-compatible (existing lockfiles with just `<pid>` still parse). Future tools can read the timestamp directly without `fs.stat`.

## Why not adopt `proper-lockfile`

`proper-lockfile` is the conventional Node library for this. But:

- Adds a runtime dep (project policy: no new deps without strong reason)
- The existing impl is ~50 LoC and handles 95% of cases; M9f's safeguard closes most of the remaining 5%
- `proper-lockfile` itself isn't bulletproof on Windows (uses similar PID-liveness)

If real-world Windows adoption hits problems past M9f, swap-in is straightforward:
- `proper-lockfile.lock(path)` → returns a release function
- API surface is similar; one ADR + one PR to swap

## Other improvements considered but deferred

| Improvement | Defer reason |
|---|---|
| Heartbeat (re-touch lockfile mtime every 30s) | Adds complexity for a rare problem; max-age alone is enough |
| Per-platform branches | Premature; max-age works on all platforms |
| Retry-with-backoff for `EBUSY` (Windows AV) | Rare; user can retry manually |
| Lockfile schema versioning | Trivial enough; not yet needed |

## Invariants (preserved + new)

- **(existing)** Lockfile contains the holder's PID (now also: ISO timestamp on second line)
- **(existing)** Stale = PID dead → reclaim
- **(new)** Stale = lockfile mtime older than `maxAgeMs` → reclaim
- **(new)** `acquire()` accepts optional `maxAgeMs` (default 5 min)
- **(unchanged)** No new deps
- **(unchanged)** All public API in `lock.ts` keeps backward-compat (additive opt only)

## Out of scope

- Adopting `proper-lockfile` library
- Heartbeat / refresh
- Lockfile schema versioning
- Cross-process notification when lock released (callers already poll/retry)
