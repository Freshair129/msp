# CONCEPT — atomic write contract

Every file in `gks/<type>/` obeys a single schema: required frontmatter fields, conditional fields based on `type`, a forbidden-fields blacklist, and field-level constraints. The validator (`src/validator/`) enforces it.

## The contract has five parts

| Part | Source | Atom |
|---|---|---|
| Required fields | §4.1 | `ADR--ATOMIC-CONTRACT-SCHEMA` (TBD M3) |
| Conditional fields | §4.2 | same |
| Forbidden fields | §4.3 | `ADR--FORBIDDEN-FIELDS-LIST` |
| Field constraints | §4.4 | same |
| Anti-hallucination rules | §4.5 | `ADR--ANTI-HALLUCINATION-RULES` |
| Epistemic + crosslinks block | §4.6 | `CONCEPT--EPISTEMIC-METADATA` + `FRAME--CROSSLINKS-VOCABULARY` |

## What "atomic" means here

An *atom* in MSP terminology is a single markdown file under `gks/<type>/<ID>.md` carrying:

1. **A frontmatter block** between two `---` delimiters with declarative metadata (id, phase, type, status, vault_id, summary, created_at/by, optional crosslinks/linked_symbols/geography).
2. **A body** in markdown that humans can read.
3. **A unique ID** that matches the filename and the canonical pattern (`TYPE--SLUG` uppercase, or `ADR-NNN` numeric).

Atoms are **content-addressable through the index** — `gks/00_index/atomic_index.jsonl` is a derived flat list of every atom's frontmatter (rebuilt by `npm run msp:index`).

## What MSP does NOT contractually enforce

- **Quality of the body text.** The validator only inspects frontmatter shape + wikilink integrity. Whether an ADR's "Decision" section is well-reasoned is a human review concern.
- **Code-symbol existence.** `linked_symbols` claims are not verified against the actual codebase — that's GitNexus / `gks lookup-by-symbol` territory.
- **Cross-tenant authority.** Multi-tenancy is the orchestrator's job above MSP.

## Why a contract at all

Without one, four predictable failure modes appear (see `CONCEPT--INBOUND-QUEUE`). The contract makes each failure mode mechanically detectable.
