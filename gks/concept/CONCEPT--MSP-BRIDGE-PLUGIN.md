# CONCEPT — MSP Bridge Plugin

## Intent

To provide a dedicated, stable integration layer between Obsidian and the cognitive_system via a custom Obsidian plugin (`msp-bridge`). This plugin will expose a reliable REST API for Smart Connections and introduce a `pgvector` adapter, ensuring high-performance semantic search and reliable connectivity as the knowledge base scales beyond the limitations of local markdown files and the default Smart Connections REST server.

## North Star

As the vault grows past 5,000 atoms or when semantic search latency exceeds 500ms, the system seamlessly transitions from local-only operations to a robust, database-backed retrieval mechanism without disrupting the existing agent workflows. The `msp-bridge` plugin acts as the authoritative gateway, abstracting the complexity of the underlying vector store (`pgvector`).

## Guiding Principles

1. **Scalability:** The architecture must effortlessly handle tens of thousands of atoms with sub-second semantic search latency.
2. **Stability:** Provide a versioned, stable API that insulates the cognitive_system from internal changes within the Smart Connections ecosystem.
3. **Pluggability:** The transition to `pgvector` should be an opt-in configuration, allowing smaller vaults to remain local-only while providing a clear upgrade path for large enterprise setups.
