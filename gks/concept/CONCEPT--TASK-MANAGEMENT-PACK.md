# CONCEPT — Task & Management Domain Pack

## Intent

To enforce operational discipline and security over task-related resources (ISSUES, RUNBOOKS, INCIDENTS) within the cognitive_system. This pack ensures that high-priority tasks are protected and that workflow transitions follow established best practices.

## North Star

Every operational atom is automatically categorized by priority and status. The system prevents low-tier agents from making strategic triage decisions and mandates human-in-the-loop (Step-up Auth) for any modifications to urgent production issues.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Workflow Integrity:** Prevent issues from being closed without a clear resolution trail (AUDIT/ADR).
2. **Priority Protection:** Escalate security requirements (MFA/PIN) proportionally to the priority of the task.
3. **Role-Based Triage:** Reserve prioritization and assignment changes for high-tier agents (T2+) or humans.

## Connections
- `[[ADR--TASK-TRACKING-AT-ORCHESTRATOR]]` — context for where volatile task state resides.
- `[[FEAT--ISSUE-TRACKER]]` — the implementation of the core issue tracking system.
