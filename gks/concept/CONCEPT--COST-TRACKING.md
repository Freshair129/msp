# CONCEPT — Cost Tracking

## Problem

`DispatchResult.cost_usd` is part of the dispatcher's public shape (per `BLUEPRINT--AGENT-DISPATCHER`) but nothing populates it. Tier prices differ by **two orders of magnitude** (T1 is free, T2 is sub-cent, T3 is dollars per million tokens). Without per-call cost estimation, three things break:

1. **Budget visibility** — operators cannot answer "what did the last 24h of dispatch cost me?"
2. **Tier-policy enforcement audit** — `ADR--AGENT-TIER-COST-POLICY` caps T3 to `critical` severity. If the cap leaks, no telemetry surfaces the waste.
3. **Meta-Learning signal** — the dispatcher's reverse-path execution traces are weaker when cost is unrecorded; future routing tweaks have no quantitative baseline to beat.

## Approach

Two layers, deliberately decoupled:

### Layer 1 — pure pricing math (`cost-tracker.ts`)

A small, dependency-free module that turns `(tier, input_tokens, output_tokens)` into a dollar estimate using a hardcoded `PRICING` table. Token counts are themselves estimated from text length (~4 chars/token — the industry-standard rough heuristic) since calling actual tokenizers per dispatch is overkill for ballpark figures.

The values are **directionally accurate, not actuarial**. The goal is "T3 is roughly 40× T2", not "to four decimal places". Pricing snapshot is dated in a code comment so a future maintainer can refresh without spelunking.

### Layer 2 — USAGE-bucket atom (`usage-recorder.ts`)

After each dispatch, append the call's tier + cost to today's `USAGE--DAILY-<isoDate>` atom. Bucket atoms accumulate over a day; first call of the day creates the file with proper frontmatter, subsequent calls update the body's JSON summary block.

This mirrors the episode-recorder pattern (one atom per logical unit, written best-effort, never fails dispatch) but trades per-call granularity for daily aggregation — readers want "what did today cost?" not "list every call".

## What this is NOT

- **Not billing.** These figures are pre-tax, pre-discount estimates from public pricing pages. They will diverge from the actual invoice.
- **Not a budget enforcer.** Tier caps and escalation are the budget mechanism (see `ADR--AGENT-TIER-COST-POLICY`). Cost tracking is observation, not control.
- **Not a tokenizer.** We estimate tokens from char-count; tier-specific tokenizers (tiktoken etc.) would be more accurate but introduce native deps and per-tier divergence.
