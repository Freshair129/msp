# CONCEPT — `msp_observe` hot-path extraction

> **Status: draft (aspirational).** Not implemented. Cherry-picked from `[[SPEC--ARCHITECTURE-V2]].md` §4.2 during the 2026-05-09 architecture-doc cleanup. Belongs in roadmap, not current scope.

## Problem

Current MSP requires the agent (or human) to be disciplined: turn → decide what's worth remembering → call `msp_remember` with a structured payload. Most conversations don't get summarised because the discipline isn't there. mem0 demonstrated that an extraction layer **between** the conversation and the store closes the gap: agents dump turns, the layer figures out what's a fact, a preference, or a goal worth persisting.

## Hypothesis

A new MCP tool `msp_observe(messages, hints?)` runs a deterministic-then-LLM pipeline that extracts retainable facts from raw turns and reconciles them against existing atoms. Agents call it after every meaningful turn; MSP decides what (if anything) becomes a new atom or supersedes an existing one.

## Pipeline

```
input: { messages: Turn[], hints?: { focus: 'fact' | 'preference' | 'goal' } }

1. Filter         — drop boilerplate / greetings / pure tool calls
2. Extract (LLM)  — "what's worth remembering here?" → list of typed facts
3. For each fact:
   3a. gks.similar(fact.text, { k: 3, threshold: 0.85 })
   3b. Reconcile (rule-based first, LLM only if ambiguous):
       - No match           → ADD (new candidate atom)
       - Exact match        → NOOP
       - Near match, contradicts → SUPERSEDE (write new + flip old)
       - Near match, refines     → UPDATE (merge into existing)
4. Batch write via msp_candidate (NOT direct gks.write — respects ADR--AGENT-WRITE-BOUNDARIES)
5. Append audit entry per op
6. Return { added: AtomId[], updated: AtomId[], superseded: AtomId[], skipped: number, audit_id }
```

## Why this matters

It's the difference between "AI with good memory" (mem0 promise) and "structured note-taker" (current MSP). Agents shouldn't have to know about atom IDs / phases / types — they dump conversation, MSP figures it out.

## Constraints

- **Goes through `msp_candidate`, not direct write.** Per `[[ADR--AGENT-WRITE-BOUNDARIES]]`, agents never touch `gks/<type>/` directly. `msp_observe` writes to `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/candidates/`; promotion stays a human PR action.
- **Reconciliation respects the contradiction policy** in `CLAUDE.md` — supersession is reciprocal (`supersedes` + `superseded_by`).
- **LLM extraction step is opt-in.** When no extractor configured, fall back to rule-based filtering only.
- **Cost budget** — every `msp_observe` call records token spend in the audit log; agents can pass `max_cost_usd` hint.

## Open questions

- What triggers `msp_observe`? Per-turn (expensive), per-N turns, on `endSession`, or agent-driven?
- Default extractor model — which Claude tier? Locally-run SLM via GKS embedder fallback?
- Schema for the typed-fact intermediate representation — reuse atom frontmatter or a smaller shape?

## Trade-offs

**Positive**
- Lowers the discipline cost of using MSP — works for "normal" agents, not just diligent ones.
- Composes naturally with `[[CONCEPT--CONSOLIDATOR]]` (which today operates on episodic memory; `msp_observe` operates on raw turns one layer up).

**Negative**
- LLM call per turn is non-trivial cost; needs per-project budget guard.
- Extraction quality is the bottleneck — bad extraction pollutes the atom graph faster than humans can clean.
- Yet-another-tool in the 16-tool MSP MCP surface; only adopt if the pipeline above proves out.
