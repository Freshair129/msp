# CONCEPT — Ollama SLM client

## Problem

`FEAT--CODEGEN-MICROTASK-RUNNER` works end to end with a mock SLM that returns either a stub or whatever the prompt's `// MOCK_OUTPUT:` hint specifies. The mock is enough for testing the pipeline mechanics but cannot produce real code for production microtasks. Until a real SLM is wired, M3c-4 is a scaffold, not a usable feature.

## Hypothesis

If the runner accepts a pluggable `SlmClient` and we ship one concrete implementation that talks to Ollama (`POST /api/generate` with `model` + `prompt`), then anyone with a local Ollama install + Qwen 2.5 Coder can run real microtasks end to end. No API key required. No network call in tests (mock `fetch`).

## Scope

In:
- HTTP client targeting Ollama's `/api/generate` endpoint (single-turn, no chat history).
- Honour `OLLAMA_HOST` (default `http://127.0.0.1:11434`) + `OLLAMA_MODEL` (default `qwen2.5-coder:7b`) env vars.
- Implements the `SlmClient` interface from `src/codegen/types.ts`.
- Surface errors clearly: connection refused, model not pulled, timeout.
- Pluggable factory `createSlmClient(opts?)` so future Anthropic / OpenAI clients drop in next to it.

Out:
- Streaming responses (we collect the full output before returning).
- Chat-history mode (the codegen retry policy strips previous attempts anyway).
- Authentication / TLS — Ollama is local-by-default.
- Anthropic / OpenAI / vLLM clients — separate atoms when needed.

## Source

Closes M3c-4's residual ("real Qwen 2.5 Coder integration is a future task"). P0 item #1 from production-readiness backlog.
