# NFR — <Title>

## Statement

System **shall** maintain <metric> <comparator> <threshold> under <load /
condition>.

## Verification approach

- **method:** load test | chaos test | pen test | continuous monitoring
- **tooling:** <k6 / locust / SLO dashboard / etc>
- **frequency:** every release / weekly / on-demand

## Threshold rationale

Why this number? (SLA, customer expectation, technical constraint)

## Failure mode

What happens if we miss this target? (degraded UX, alert fires,
incident triggered, refund obligation)
