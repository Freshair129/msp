# GUARD — <Title>

## Constraint

State the rule precisely. "Agent must NEVER do X when Y."

## Rationale

Why this constraint exists. Reference the ADR / incident / regulation
that prompted it.

## Detection

How the violation is detected at runtime:
- input check: ...
- post-action audit: ...

## Enforcement

What happens on violation:
- block the action / rollback
- log to audit
- alert on-call
- agent is informed and cannot retry

## Examples

**Triggered:** `<concrete example that hits the rule>`
**Allowed:** `<concrete example that passes>`

## Bypass policy

Who can override (if anyone) and how. If no bypass, state explicitly.
