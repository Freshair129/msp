# HOTFIX — <one-line summary of what was fixed>

## Why this exists

This atom is the audit trail for a hotfix that shipped before the normal
P1–P3 atoms (`CONCEPT--`, `ADR--`, `BLUEPRINT--`) existed. It opens a
48-hour backfill window (master-spec §6.4, ADR-014).

## What was fixed

Brief description of the production symptom and the change shipped to
resolve it.

## Backfill checklist (must complete before `valid_to`)

- [ ] `CONCEPT--<NAME>` written and `stable`
- [ ] `ADR--<NAME>` written and `stable` (with `crosslinks.resolves: [HOTFIX--<sha>]`)
- [ ] `BLUEPRINT--<NAME>` written and `stable` (geography matches the actual files touched)
- [ ] `gks verify-flow FEAT--<NAME>` returns exit-0

After `valid_to`, the pre-commit hook blocks any further commit on the
affected files until every box above is checked.
