## Indicator (SLI)

What is measured.

```
metric:    <e.g. http_requests_total successful / http_requests_total all>
window:    <e.g. rolling 30 days>
exclusion: <maintenance windows / known degradations>
```

## Target

```
objective: <e.g. 99.9% successful requests / month>
threshold: <e.g. error budget = 0.1% × monthly request volume>
```

## Alert thresholds
