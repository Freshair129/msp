# Pairing GKS with MSP

> **Why this doc exists.** GKS was deliberately built without MSP as a hard
> dependency — to keep it usable with any Memory OS layer above. But MSP
> *is* the primary Memory OS this repo was designed against, and that
> design intent isn't visible from the code alone. Without this doc, new
> contributors (and future us) see the inbound queue, the
> `.brain/msp/...` defaults, the write-protected `gks/` and wonder *why*.
> The "why" is MSP. This doc records the relationship without coupling
> the two.

## TL;DR

- **GKS** = storage engine (this repo). Owns: atomic / vector / episodic
  / obsidian, audit log, namespace, MCP server, CLI.
- **MSP** = Memory OS passport / orchestrator. Agent-agnostic (plugs into Claude Code, Antigravity, EVA, etc.).
  Owns: schema validation, ID-uniqueness, wikilink resolution, candidates
  workflow, and agent-specific episodic memory.
- **Which MSP?**: There are two. **MSP-v9.1** (Python) is EVA's biological memory system. **MSP-this-repo** (TypeScript) is the agent-agnostic orchestrator described here.
- **Contract**: GKS exposes `proposeInbound()` (TypeScript API) and `gks_propose_inbound` (MCP tool) as the entry point for candidate atoms. MSP wraps these as the `msp_candidate` MCP tool for agent ergonomics. MSP validates + **human PR review** is the only path that promotes to `gks/`; the canonical store is write-protected.
  - **Naming note:** GKS keeps the historical `Inbound` name in its API surface for backward compatibility; the conceptual workflow on top is now called **candidates** (post-Phase-3 migration, 2026-05-09). Both refer to the same underlying write path.

## Why GKS doesn't ship MSP itself

1. **Scope** — workflow / governance lives outside the storage engine
   (see [`SCOPE.md`](../SCOPE.md) "Out of scope").
2. **Pluggability** — many Memory OS shapes are valid: EVA's MSP-v9.1,
   FRAMEWORK_MASTER_SPEC's gatekeeper, or a custom thin one. GKS shouldn't
   force one.
3. **Versioning** — MSP evolves with your project lifecycle; coupling
   would mean every MSP change forces a GKS release.

## Design intent baked into GKS

These choices are **not** accidental — they exist *specifically* to leave
room for an MSP-shaped layer above:

| GKS code | What it enforces | Why MSP needs it |
|---|---|---|
| `src/memory/inbound.ts` constructor | Refuses inbound dir inside `gksRoot` | `gks/` stays write-protected; inbound is the only entry |
| `MemoryStore.proposeInbound()` (`src/memory/index.ts`) | Single write API for candidate atoms | MSP can't be bypassed |
| `src/memory/atomic-id.ts` `ATOMIC_ID_PATTERN` | TYPE--SLUG format check | MSP's ID conventions plug in here |
| `src/memory/index.ts` `gksLayout()` | GKS default paths: `.brain/msp/projects/<path>/{inbound,session,memory,audit}/` (still emits `inbound/` for back-compat) | Modern MSP overrides `inboundDir` option to write to `candidates/` instead — same underlying write path, different directory name |
| `src/memory/inbound.ts` `renderArtifactMarkdown` | Stamps namespace + frontmatter | MSP reviewers see provenance |
| `src/memory/audit.ts` (append-only JSONL) | Every write op is logged | MSP relies on this for traceability |

If you ever feel like changing one of these "for convenience", check this
table first — you're probably about to break the MSP contract.

## What MSP brings on top

MSP is the gatekeeper between agents and the canonical SSOT (`gks/`).
What MSP owns (and GKS does *not*):

- **Validation pipeline**
  - Frontmatter schema (`atomic_contract.yaml`)
  - ID uniqueness (e.g. ADR number = max+1)
  - Wikilink resolution (`[[X]]` must resolve to a real atom)
  - Forbidden fields (`commit_hash`, `reviewer_approved_at`, …)
- **Workflow (Modern)**
  - Agent → `msp_candidate` (MCP) → `.brain/.../candidates/` → human PR review → merge to `gks/`
- **Workflow (Legacy)**
  - Agent → `/submit-memory` → inbound queue → human review → promote → `gks/`
- **Process artifacts (EVA-specific)**
  - `MSP-IMP-` (P3 plan) → `MSP-TSK-` (P4 task) → `MSP-ACT-` (P5 action)
    → `MSP-WKT-` (P6 walkthrough). Note: the TypeScript MSP is agent-agnostic and does not enforce these specific IDs by default.
- **CLI commands (current — MSP TypeScript)**
  - `npm run msp:validate` / `msp:check-links` / `msp:index` / `msp:backlinks` / `msp:verify` — atom integrity
  - `npm run msp:run-task` — micro-task codegen runner
  - `npm run msp:master` — MASTER-- atom tooling
  - `npm run msp:hotfix:open` / `list` / `check` / `close` — 48h backfill window for HOTFIX
- **CLI commands (removed in Phase 3, 2026-05-09)**
  - `npm run msp:propose` / `msp:list` / `msp:promote` — **deleted**. Use `msp_candidate` MCP tool instead. There is no CLI promote — promotion is `git merge` of the PR only (per `ADR--AGENT-WRITE-BOUNDARIES`).
- **Pre-commit hook**
  - Blocks commits if MSP validation fails
- **Contract files**
  - `.brain/msp/LLM_Contract/atomic_contract.yaml` (atomic schema)
  - `.brain/msp/LLM_Contract/codegen_microtask_contract.yaml` (Phase 3.5)

None of this lives in GKS.

## Other Memory OS layers that fit

Anything that honours the contract above works. References:

- **EVA's MSP-v9.1** (Python) — biological consolidation Memory OS, adds
  Session→Core→Sphere cascade + RI levels + RMS affect.
- **[`examples/memory-os-architecture/`](../examples/memory-os-architecture/)** —
  Python reference impl that layers a paradigm-agnostic Memory OS on
  GKS, with EVA-specific extensions in a separate plugin module.
- **Custom thin gatekeeper** — minimum viable: validate before calling
  `proposeInbound()`, implement your own promote step, append to
  `gks/00_index/atomic_index.jsonl`. Doesn't need RMS, cascades, or
  affect — just the contract below.

## Compatibility checklist (for Memory OS implementers)

If you're building a Memory OS for GKS, verify:

- [ ] Reads happen via `gks_recall` / `gks_lookup` (no special contract)
- [ ] Writes go *only* through `proposeInbound()` — never directly to `gks/`
- [ ] Frontmatter validated against your schema **before** calling
      `proposeInbound` — GKS only checks ID format + phase range
- [ ] Promote step moves `candidates/<id>.md` (or legacy `inbound/`) →
      `gks/<phase>/<type>/<slug>.md` via **git PR + squash-merge** (not a CLI step in modern MSP)
- [ ] After merge, regenerate `gks/00_index/atomic_index.jsonl` via `npm run msp:index`
- [ ] Your process-artifact IDs (`MSP-IMP-` / `-TSK-` / `-WKT-`) carry
      `sessionId` for traceability — but stored wherever you choose,
      *not* in `gks/`
- [ ] Wikilink resolution + ID uniqueness + forbidden fields enforced
      *by you* (GKS won't catch these)

That's it. GKS won't help you enforce these — they're your responsibility
as the Memory OS implementer.

## Coexisting with peer subsystems (e.g. GitNexus)

GKS isn't the only specialised subsystem your Memory OS will want to
talk to. Code-intelligence engines (e.g. [GitNexus](https://github.com/nxpatterns/gitnexus)),
external KBs, observability stores, vector-search-as-a-service — these
are *peers* of GKS, not layers above or below it.

The pattern: **MSP orchestrates; GKS does not proxy.** GKS has no
knowledge of GitNexus (no import, no MCP-tool-that-fans-out, no
optional dependency). When MSP needs a correlated answer it fans out
in parallel and merges:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent                             │
└────────────────┬─────────────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ MSP — orchestrator                │
│  • routes per query type          │
│  • parallel fan-out + merge       │
└──┬──────────────────────┬────────┘
   │                      │
   ▼                      ▼
┌────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│  GKS       │    │  GitNexus    │
│  memory    │    │  code AST    │
└────────────┘    └──────────────┘
   (peers — no edge between them)
```

Worked example — agent asks *"What does ADR-007 say, and what would
break if I refactor the function it governs?"*:

```
agent → MSP
         ├── GKS.lookup("ADR-007")             ← parallel
         └── GitNexus.impact("formatStep")     ← parallel
        merged response back to agent
```

The decision and full reasoning live in
[ADR-009](./adr/009-msp-as-orchestrator.md). Importantly: caching
GitNexus call-edges into GKS's `GraphBackend` for fast reads is
*allowed* and is **not** a violation — that's denormalisation owned by
MSP, not a runtime dependency.

### Cross-referencing code from atomic notes

Atomic notes can carry a `linked_symbols` field naming the code symbols
they govern; MSP resolves those references against GitNexus when a
correlated answer is needed.

```ts
await retain(store, {
  content: 'Normalize spoofed [USER]/[AGENT] tags before LLM consolidation.',
  proposeInbound: true,
  inboundType: 'adr',
  inboundPhase: 2,
  linkedSymbols: [
    { file: 'src/memory/consolidator-llm.ts', fn: 'formatStep' },
    { file: 'src/memory/consolidator-llm.ts', fn: 'validateExtractorOutput', line: 320 },
  ],
})
```

Renders into the candidate markdown (under `.brain/.../candidates/`) as:

```yaml
---
proposed_id: ADR--PARSE-TRACE-NORM
phase: 2
type: adr
status: raw
linked_symbols:
  - {"file":"src/memory/consolidator-llm.ts","fn":"formatStep"}
  - {"file":"src/memory/consolidator-llm.ts","fn":"validateExtractorOutput","line":320}
---
```

GKS only stores + serialises these — it does not parse code, resolve
symbols, or check that they exist. Resolution is the orchestrator's
job (call GitNexus, dereference, merge with the atom's text). The
field is also exposed via the `gks_propose_inbound` MCP tool's
`linked_symbols` input.

For the MCP-config recipe that runs both servers side-by-side, see
the README section [Pairing with a code-structure layer](../README.md#pairing-with-a-code-structure-layer-eg-gitnexus).

## Task tracking — orchestrator territory (ADR-015)

Live task / subtask / microtask state is **execution state**, not
durable knowledge. It belongs to the orchestrator, not GKS.

The boundary:

| Concern | Layer | Atom / file |
|---|---|---|
| Why we plan to do X | GKS (durable) | `CONCEPT--` |
| What we decided | GKS (durable) | `ADR--` |
| What user-facing thing X does | GKS (durable) | `FEAT--` |
| Plan for which files X touches | GKS (durable) | `BLUEPRINT--` (`geography`) |
| Live task status (open/in-progress/done) | **MSP / orchestrator** | task tracker |
| Per-microtask agent prompt | **MSP / orchestrator** | `T<n>_<slug>.task.yaml` |
| Subtask decomposition | **MSP / orchestrator** | tracker tree |
| Reviewer chatter / comments | **MSP / orchestrator** | tracker comments |
| Verification outcome | GKS (durable) | `AUDIT--` |

Atoms have **settling time** — they're meant to be cited unchanged a
year later. Tasks churn hourly. Mixing the two would pollute the SSOT
with hundreds of completed-task corpses inside six months.

### Concrete handoff between layers

```
GKS                                    MSP / orchestrator
─────                                  ──────────────────

BLUEPRINT--FOO  ──── geography ────►   create tracker entries per file
                     (file paths)      assign agents, run microtasks

                                       (live status churns here —
                                        not visible to GKS)

                                       tracker entry closes
                                       │
                  ◄── propose_inbound ─┘
AUDIT--FOO  ◄── promote                  with outcome + numbers
   │
   └─ crosslinks.references: [FEAT--FOO, BLUEPRINT--FOO]
```

### Where microtasks live (pick one)

- **`.brain/<ns>/tasks/<slug>/T<n>_<name>.task.yaml`** — self-hosted,
  no separate orchestrator. `gks new-feature --task-tracker=local`
  drops skeletons here.
- **`msp/projects/<id>/tasks/`** — a real MSP layer is in play. The
  scaffolder emits guidance lines pointing at the MSP API; MSP owns
  the actual writes.
- **External tracker (Linear / Jira / Asana)** — `BLUEPRINT--` may
  carry a tracker URL in its frontmatter `meta`. Tasks live in the
  external system; GKS only sees them indirectly via `AUDIT--`.

In every case GKS treats microtasks as **opaque** — it does not index
them, walk them in `verify-flow`, or try to enforce their integrity.
That's deliberate: the lifecycles are different, the storage shapes
should be too.
