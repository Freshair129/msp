# ADR — Genesis Block Engine as a GKS backend

## Context

`CONCEPT--GENESIS-BLOCK-ENGINE` frames the desire for a sovereign,
embedded, Cypher-capable graph engine forked from LadybugDB. The
remaining question is **how it integrates with the existing stack**.

Three options were considered.

| Option | What it means | Cost | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Peer package** | New `packages/genesis-block/` peer of GKS; MSP chooses which storage to talk to at config time. | New MCP surface, duplicates `retain` / `recall` / `reflect`, two source of truth for bi-temporal logic. | High — re-implements GKS contracts; drift inevitable. |
| **B — Replace GKS** | Migrate `packages/msp/` to talk to the new engine; delete `packages/gks/`. | Rewrite all four GKS layers (Atomic / Vector / Episodic / Obsidian). Migrate 60+ ADRs / FRAMEs. | Very high — multi-quarter; breaks every dependent. |
| **C — Backend of GKS** (chosen) | New engine implements `GraphBackend` (`packages/gks/src/memory/graph.ts:375`); GKS still owns `MemoryStore` and the public API. | Single Rust crate + thin TS adapter (~600 LoC). | Low — additive; ADR-003 already authorises new backends. |

Option C is the only one that honours
[`ADR-003`](../../packages/gks/docs/adr/003-pluggable-backends.md)
(*pluggable backends are first-class*), and avoids contradicting
[`ADR-008`](../../packages/gks/docs/adr/008-gks-storage-engine-scope.md)
(*GKS is the storage engine — orchestration lives above*).

## Decision

**The Genesis Block Engine is implemented as a new GKS `GraphBackend`.**

Concretely:

1. **Code lives at** `packages/gks/src/memory/graph/genesis-block.ts`
   (TypeScript adapter) and `packages/gks/native/genesis-block/`
   (Rust crate, forked from LadybugDB).
2. **The adapter implements the full `GraphBackend` surface** — five
   methods declared at `packages/gks/src/memory/graph.ts:375`:
   `load`, `addNode`, `addEdge`, `retractEdge`, `query`, `neighbors`.
3. **The Rust crate exposes its surface via `napi-rs`** as a single
   `.node` native addon, prebuilt for `darwin-x64`, `darwin-arm64`,
   `linux-x64-gnu`, `linux-arm64-gnu`, `win32-x64-msvc` and shipped
   in the `@freshair129/gks` npm tarball under `native/prebuild/`.
4. **No new MCP tools are added.** The existing 13 GKS MCP tools call
   into `MemoryStore`, which calls the configured `GraphBackend` —
   Genesis Block sits below that line and inherits the surface for
   free.
5. **The default `GraphBackend` does not change.** New `MemoryStore`
   instances still use the in-memory `GraphStore` unless the caller
   passes `graphBackend: createGenesisBlockBackend(...)`. This
   preserves the zero-dependency quickstart promise.
6. **OpenCypher is exposed as an opt-in extension method**, not part
   of the base `GraphBackend` interface. Callers that want to issue
   Cypher use a downcast: `(backend as GenesisBlockBackend).cypher(q)`.
   The MSP `verify-flow` and Impact-Analysis paths gain a Cypher
   path; everything else continues to use `neighbors()` / `query()`.

### Reconciling with ADR-005

[`ADR-005`](../../packages/gks/docs/adr/005-cut-falkordb.md) cut
FalkorDB partly to remove a Redis-module native dependency. Adding a
`.node` addon at first glance re-introduces native code — but the
trade-off is different:

- FalkorDB required a **running Redis server** at runtime; users had
  to install and start a separate process.
- Genesis Block ships as a **process-local addon** loaded once at
  startup. No separate process, no port, no daemon.
- Prebuilt binaries are now standard practice for the Node ecosystem
  (`@napi-rs/cli`, `prebuildify`, `node-pre-gyp`). The install-time
  failure modes that drove ADR-005 (compilation toolchain dependence)
  are mitigated.

ADR-005 stays in force for **server-class native dependencies**;
this ADR carves out a narrow exception for process-local prebuilt
addons.

### Reconciling with ADR-001

[`ADR-001`](../../packages/gks/docs/adr/001-file-based-vector-store.md)
chose JSONL as the default vector store for diff-ability and git
friendliness. This ADR does **not** touch the vector layer. The graph
backend's `.db` file is opaque binary; that is acceptable because:

- The source of truth for atom content remains the `.md` files in
  `gks/<type>/`.
- The graph backend's `.db` is a **derived index**, like a SQLite
  cache. Losing it is recoverable by replaying the parser over the
  Markdown vault.
- The user-visible `git diff` story is preserved because the `.db`
  file is gitignored; only the Markdown atoms it indexes are
  committed.

A `BLUEPRINT--GENESIS-BLOCK-INTEGRATION` task tracks adding a
`.gitignore` entry for `*.gks-graph.db` in the published templates.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **No public-API churn.** `retain` / `recall` / `reflect` / MCP tools
  / CLI all unchanged. Existing tests in `packages/gks/test/memory/`
  cover the new backend by parameterisation.
- **Cypher as opt-in superpower.** MSP's Impact-Analysis path can
  migrate to one-line Cypher queries; everything else stays.
- **Sovereignty preserved.** The fork is the source of truth for the
  storage format; we control the roadmap.
- **Performance ceiling raised.** A columnar, on-disk store with a
  proper page cache outperforms the in-memory `GraphStore` once edge
  count exceeds a few hundred thousand.

### Negative

- **New native build pipeline.** GKS's CI must now build and publish
  prebuilt `.node` artifacts across five target triples. Adds ~10 min
  to release time.
- **Rust toolchain becomes part of GKS's developer onboarding.**
  Contributors who only touch TypeScript are unaffected
  (`npm install` pulls the prebuilt binary), but anyone modifying
  the engine needs `rustup`.
- **Schema migrations gain a second axis.** The `.db` format will
  evolve; we need a version byte at the front and a migration
  routine, mirroring the manifest-version policy GKS already has
  (`src/lib/schema-version.ts`).

### Neutral

- The PRD's framing of an "active engine" with Parser + Syncer +
  Analytic + Interface collapses to: Parser stays in MSP, Syncer is
  the existing `npm run msp:index`, Analytic is `verify-flow` /
  `validateLinks` / Impact-Analysis (some moving to Cypher),
  Interface is the existing MCP server. The engine itself is
  passive — same as the rest of GKS per ADR-008.

## Status

**Draft.** This ADR is the artifact for the P2 decision step of
`CONCEPT--GENESIS-BLOCK-ENGINE`. Promotion to `stable` requires:

1. A green CI run against the existing graph test suite with the
   `GenesisBlockBackend` swapped in via `parametrize`.
2. A benchmark run on the 50k/500k fixture from CONCEPT's success
   criteria.
3. A reviewer sign-off on the ADR-005 / ADR-001 reconciliation
   sections above.
