# ADR — Process tracing traversal strategy

## Context
We need to implement a tracer that follows `CALLS` edges in the Symbol Graph. The graph may contain cycles (recursion) and very deep paths.

## Decision
1. **Algorithm**: Use a depth-limited search (DLS) or BFS with a visited set to detect cycles.
2. **Depth Limit**: Set a default limit of **8 hops**. This is sufficient for most application-level flows while preventing performance degradation on extremely complex graphs.
3. **Entry Points**: Explicitly use the nodes emitted by `FrameworkRecognizer` (kinds: `page`, `route`, `tool`) as the seeds for tracing.
4. **Resolution**: Only follow `resolved: true` edges to maintain high precision in the resulting paths.

## Consequences
- Recursive flows will be truncated at the first cycle.
- Deep utility chains beyond 8 hops will be truncated (user can override depth via CLI/MCP).
- Unresolved dynamic calls will act as "leafs" in the trace.

## Alternatives
- Exhaustive search (too slow on large graphs).
- Abstract interpretation (too complex for v1).
