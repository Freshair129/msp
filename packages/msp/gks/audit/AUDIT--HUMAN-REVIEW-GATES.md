# AUDIT — M5e

## Scope

Two changes:
1. Wrote `ADR--HUMAN-REVIEW-GATES` — fills the dangling reference in `ADR--PROMOTION-WORKFLOW` ("see ADR--HUMAN-REVIEW-GATES (TBD)"). Maps every atom type to a reviewer (Boss vs T3 self-review).
2. Updated `msp_spec.md` §12 to reflect `ADR--PATH-ENCODING` (bare name like `evaAI`, not `D--<name>`). Removes the "open issue" framing.

## Verification

- Validator passes the new ADR (validates per `evidence-for-decisions` from M5c — has Context/Decision/Consequences sections).
- `gks verify-flow` chains with this ADR resolve cleanly.
- 78/78 atoms validate after both changes.

## Sign-off

- Implemented by: @claude-opus-4-7
- Verified by: validator + verify-flow + manual diff review
- Date: 2026-05-03
