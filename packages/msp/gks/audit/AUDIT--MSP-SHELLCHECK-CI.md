# AUDIT — M5f

## Scope

L1 infrastructure — added `shellcheck examples/hooks/*.sh` step to CI right after `npm ci`. Ubuntu runners ship shellcheck so no `apt-get install` step needed.

## Verification

- shellcheck 0.9.0 locally — clean against both `pre-commit-validator.sh` and `install.sh` (and the new `pre-push-verify.sh` from M5a after one SC2001 disable was applied).
- CI will exercise on next push.

## Why care

Pre-commit hooks shipping with bash bugs (unquoted expansions, `set -e` interactions) silently lose protection. shellcheck catches these statically. Cheap to run, big upside.

## Sign-off

- Implemented by: @claude-opus-4-7
- Verified by: local shellcheck run; CI step lands with this PR
