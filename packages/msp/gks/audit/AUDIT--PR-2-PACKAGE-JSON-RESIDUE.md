# AUDIT — PR #50 package.json residue cleaned up

## What was missed

PR #50 (Phase 3 of `BLUEPRINT--INBOUND-TO-CANDIDATES-MIGRATION`) deleted `scripts/msp/propose.mjs` along with the `msp_propose` MCP tool, scripts entries (`msp:propose`, `msp:list`, `msp:promote`), and inbound-related code paths. However it left two residual references in `package.json`:

1. `bin.msp-propose: "./scripts/msp/propose.mjs"` — pointed at a now-deleted file. Any consumer running `npm install` against this package would fail or get a broken symlink.
2. `files[]: "scripts/msp/propose.mjs"` — would be packed into a publish tarball, except the file no longer existed.

Discovered post-merge during a manual smoke test of `npm run msp:master compose ...` (PR-6). `npm install` did not fail in our local dev workflow because we run from source via `tsx`, not from a packed install.

## What this PR fixes

- Remove `bin.msp-propose` line from `package.json`
- Remove `scripts/msp/propose.mjs` from `package.json` `files` array

No code, test, or atom changes beyond this audit.

## Why this didn't show up in PR #50 CI

Phase 3's verification gates (`npm test`, validator, check-links, msp:index) all run against the source tree, not against a published/installed package. CI never invoked `npm pack` or `npm install` against the package itself. The bin entry is harmless when running scripts via the `msp:*` aliases in `package.json` `scripts`, which is what every MSP test uses.

## Correctness verification

- `grep -r "scripts/msp/propose.mjs" package.json` → 0 hits after this PR
- `grep -r "msp-propose" package.json` → 0 hits after this PR (the bin name is gone)
- `npm run msp:master compose MASTER--MSP-DOC-TO-CODE MASTER--ATOM-CONTRADICTION-POLICY` → still works (output unchanged from PR-6 smoke test)
- `npm test` — green
- `npm pack --dry-run` would now succeed without missing-file errors (not run in CI; verified locally)

## Lesson

When deleting a script in a future cleanup PR, also grep `package.json` for both `bin.<name>` and `files[]` entries pointing at the script. Add this grep to a future `PROTO--PACKAGE-JSON-DEAD-REFS` predicate (deferred — not urgent given how rare this class of bug is).
