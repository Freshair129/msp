# AUDIT — Session 2026-05-09

> **Historical snapshot.** Numbers below are end-of-day 2026-05-09 totals (193 atoms / 625 tests / 16 MCP tools). Subsequent work (Phase A–D, 2026-05-10) changed those counts — see `AUDIT--ARCH-DOC-CLEANUP`, `AUDIT--PHASE-B-IMPL-COMPLETE`, `AUDIT--PHASE-C-AGENT-INTEGRATION-DOCS`, `AUDIT--POST-PHASE-D-DOC-POLISH`. This atom intentionally preserves the 2026-05-09 state without revising it.

Single-day session that shipped two major architectural axes (3-tier knowledge model + Symbol Graph layer) plus reconciliation cleanup. 16 PRs merged across the 3 waves.

## What shipped (16 PRs)

### Wave 1 — Inbound→Candidates migration + 3-tier knowledge model (8 PRs)

## Final state — counts (end of 2026-05-09)

| Dimension | Start of session | End of session | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|

## Doc / code / algo / tech-stack consistency check (end of 2026-05-09)

### Consistent

- **193 atoms** all carry `tier:` + `source_type:` (validated by `tier-enum` warn-level rule)
- **2 Master atoms** both satisfy `master-requires-promotion` (have `promoted_from` + `promoted_at` + `promotion_adr`; no `learned_from`)
- **16 MCP tools** registered in `src/mcp/server.ts` `TOOLS` array; matches assertions in `test/mcp/server.test.ts` + `test/mcp/bin.test.ts` + `test/mcp/tools/candidate.test.ts`
- **6 bin entries** in `package.json`: msp-validate, msp-backlinks, msp-run-task, msp-master, msp-mcp-server, msp-graph — all point at existing `dist/` artifacts
- **`@aflsolutions/graphology-communities-leiden` 1.1.1** + **`graphology-communities-louvain` 2.0.2** fallback installed; matches `ADR--LEIDEN-COMMUNITY-DETECTION`
- **`better-sqlite3` 11.x** with WAL mode; matches `ADR--SYMBOL-GRAPH-PERSISTENCE`
- **TypeScript Compiler API parser** (per `CONCEPT--PARSER-CHOICE`); tree-sitter NOT a dep; matches v1 decision
- **Symbol Graph build smoke** (PR-4): 897 symbols / 1843 edges / 143 communities, modularity 0.958 — recorded in `AUDIT--SYMBOL-GRAPH-V1`
- **Master Block compose** smoke: 2 atoms = 720 tokens; both ≤ 400-token warn threshold
- **`FRAME--AUTHORITY-MATRIX`** body lists current paths (singular, with `master/` `proto/` rows; no `inbound/` references)
- **`FRAME--KNOWLEDGE-3-TIER`** ↔ `FRAME--SYMBOL-GRAPH` correctly orthogonal (knowledge-class axis vs structural axis)
- **All 21 FEATs** pass `gks verify-flow` (no draft atoms in any FEAT's reachable graph)
- **Validator gates** (`npx tsx src/validator/cli.ts --all`) exit 0 across the 16 PRs
- **CI** green on Node 20 + 22 across all 16 PRs (7 transient retries — npm registry / determinism)

### Known drift at end-of-day (most resolved by Phase A–D on 2026-05-10; see header note)

- `CORE_FRAMEWORK_MASTER_SPEC.md` §15.1 did not yet mention `msp:master` and `msp:graph` scripts (added in W1.6 / W3.4). **Resolved**: file removed entirely in Phase A (PR #65) once it was clear it was EVA project's spec, not MSP's.
- `CORE_FRAMEWORK_MASTER_SPEC.md` §16.5 listed 11 MCP tools; reality at session end was 16. **Resolved**: same removal.
- `CORE_FRAMEWORK_MASTER_SPEC.md` §4.1 and §7.3 issues. **Resolved**: same removal.
- `upstream/gks-proposals/05-symbol-graph.md` filed in repo but not yet filed as upstream issue. Status unchanged.
- `linked_symbols[]` on FEAT atoms not yet populated with real symbol IDs. Status unchanged.

## Architectural axes after this session

        Structural axis ─▶ symbols / edges / communities (Leiden)

                                              ▼
                                              .brain/.../symbols/{graph.db, *.jsonl}
                                              MSP repo: 897 symbols / 1843 edges
                                              / 143 communities

        Authority axis ─▶ T1 / T2 / T3 / Boss (orthogonal to Knowledge-class)
        (FRAME--AUTHORITY-MATRIX)
```

The 4 axes (Knowledge-class, Conceptual graph, Structural graph, Authority) are independently queryable and orthogonal. Each has its own validator rules, MCP tools, CLI, and storage path.

## Tech stack additions

| Package | Version | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `better-sqlite3` | ^11.10 | Symbol Graph SQLite store | `ADR--SYMBOL-GRAPH-PERSISTENCE` |
| `graphology` | ^0.25 | Graph data structure | `ADR--LEIDEN-COMMUNITY-DETECTION` |
| `graphology-types` | ^0.24 | TypeScript types | sibling of above |
| `@aflsolutions/graphology-communities-leiden` | ^1.1 | Leiden community detection | primary |
| `graphology-communities-louvain` | ^2.0 | Louvain fallback | dynamic-import |
| `@types/better-sqlite3` | ^7.6 | dev typing | typing |

All in `dependencies` (Leiden + Louvain dynamic-import-with-try-catch keeps install simple).

Existing stack unchanged: TypeScript ESM strict, Vitest, Express, MCP SDK, `@freshair129/gks` 3.6.

## Lessons learned (logged for next session)

1. **`graphology@0.25` ESM-of-CJS named-import bug** — `import { UndirectedGraph } from 'graphology'` fails at runtime but typechecks. PR-3 didn't catch it because no test triggered the leiden import path. PR-4 fixed in-line. Lesson: every new module needs at least one runtime-trigger test, not just type tests.
2. **`gks verify-flow` doesn't accept draft atoms in FEAT chains** — first SG PR-2 attempt failed CI because new FEATs reached draft FRAME/CONCEPTs. Lesson: when shipping atoms across multiple PRs, the early ones must be `stable` if downstream PRs will reference them. Promote ahead. (This lesson re-applied 2026-05-10 — see `AUDIT--POST-PHASE-D-DOC-POLISH` for the `CONCEPT--NAMED-PROJECT-REGISTRY` promotion.)
3. **Per-file `ts.Program` parser limits cross-file resolution** — actual SG counts (897 symbols / 1843 edges) were ~5× lower than BLUEPRINT estimate (~5000 / ~20000) because each file gets its own type-checker. Documented; Phase 2 fix when needed.
4. **Doc drift is invisible until grep'd** — CORE_FRAMEWORK had 9 drift points found by audit subagent (#56 fixed 5; rest deferred). On 2026-05-10 the file was removed entirely (Phase A) once it became clear it was EVA's spec.
5. **Worktree subagents need `npm ci` first** — already in CLAUDE.md; reaffirmed across 3 subagent runs.
6. **Empty commit re-triggers CI** for transient npm registry flakes; standard pattern.

## What's NOT in this session (Wave references — most retired by Phase A–D, see header note)

The original `NEXT-SESSION.md` from this session (not preserved — superseded) proposed:
- Wave 1.1 "Reconciliation v2" — **retired** by Phase A removing CORE_FRAMEWORK entirely
- Wave 2.3 "Auto-inject hook for Master atoms" — open
- Wave 3.1 "Cross-file project-wide `ts.Program`" — open
- Wave 3.3 "Tree-sitter parser for multi-language" — open
- Wave 4.3 "CLAUDE.md migration to Master atoms" — open

## Source

- 16 PRs merged 2026-05-09: #48 → #63 (skipping the unused/cancelled internal numbers)
- Audits this session: `AUDIT--PR-2-PACKAGE-JSON-RESIDUE`, `AUDIT--CORE-FRAMEWORK-RECONCILE-V1`, `AUDIT--INBOUND-TO-CANDIDATES-MIGRATION-COMPLETE`, `AUDIT--SYMBOL-GRAPH-V1`, this atom
- Companion PR #64 also proposed a `NEXT-SESSION.md` startup guide; that file was discarded on 2026-05-10 because Phase A–D made most of its waves either complete or retired. This AUDIT atom alone preserves the session record.
