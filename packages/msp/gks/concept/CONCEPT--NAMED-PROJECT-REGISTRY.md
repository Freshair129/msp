# CONCEPT — Named-project registry

> **Status: stable.** Core registry + 4-step resolver shipped in Phase B (`src/projects/{registry,resolve,types}.ts` + `msp_project_{list,register,resolve}` MCP tools — see `AUDIT--PHASE-B-IMPL-COMPLETE`). Cross-project recall (the `cross_project: true` flag described in §"Cross-project search" below) is the one remaining future extension; tracked as a small follow-up. Cherry-picked from `SPEC--ARCHITECTURE-V2.md` §4.4 during the 2026-05-09 architecture-doc cleanup.

## Problem

Today, project namespace is effectively hardcoded — most code paths assume `evaAI` (per `ADR--PATH-ENCODING`). Agents that want to operate across multiple projects (clinic, MSP-self, EVA, custom) have no first-class way to switch. Every cognitive-layer client (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity) needs its own ad-hoc cwd-based heuristic, and cross-project recall requires manual path juggling.

## Hypothesis

Treat **project** as a first-class concept resolved from a small, predictable chain. One YAML registry maps short names to filesystem paths + per-project settings (embedder, retrieval defaults). Agents pass a name, MSP resolves it.

## Registry shape

```yaml
# ~/.msp/projects.yaml  (global)
projects:
  default:
    path: ~/.msp/projects/default
    embedder: nomic-embed-text-v1.5
  eva:
    path: ~/eva
    embedder: nomic-embed-text-v1.5
  msp:
    path: ~/msp
    embedder: nomic-embed-text-v1.5
  clinic:
    path: ~/clinic
    embedder: nomic-embed-text-v1.5
```

## Resolution priority

1. Explicit: `--project=<name>` CLI flag or MCP tool argument
2. Env: `MSP_PROJECT=<name>`
3. File: `.mspconfig` in cwd or any ancestor (single line: `project: eva` or full TOML/YAML)
4. Fallback: `default`

The resolved name is looked up in `~/.msp/projects.yaml` to obtain the path + settings. If the name is unknown, MSP errors loudly rather than silently falling back — projects must be registered.

## Cross-project search (future extension)

`msp_recall { query, cross_project: true }` walks all registered projects' vector stores in parallel and merges results via RRF. Audit log records which project each hit came from. **Not yet implemented** — `msp_recall` currently scopes to the resolved project. Tracked as a follow-up to Phase B.

## Migration path

- Existing `evaAI` namespace → registered as `default` project (or `eva`, depending on naming preference).
- Old hardcoded paths read from a compatibility shim that delegates to the registry.
- `ADR--PATH-ENCODING` (bare-name decision) stays valid — the registry uses bare names too.

## Open questions

- Schema for `.mspconfig` — TOML, YAML, JSON, or single-line shorthand? Lean toward single-line shorthand for the common case + full file for the rare one.
- Per-project secrets (e.g. Anthropic key for cross-project consolidation) — registry value or external? External (per `ADR--GLOBAL-VS-WORKSPACE`).
- Identity/soul global vs per-project — **resolved** in `ADR--GLOBAL-VS-WORKSPACE`: global at `~/.msp/identity.json` with optional sparse per-project override at `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/identity.override.json`.

## Why this fits the agent-agnostic vision

Per `CONCEPT--AGENT-AGNOSTIC`, every cognitive-layer client points at the same `msp-mcp-server` bin. The registry means **"which project"** is the only thing that varies between invocations from Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and custom agents. Switching projects becomes an env var, not a code change.

## Trade-offs

**Positive**
- Multi-project workflows become viable — clinic and EVA can share the same MSP install without confusion.
- `.mspconfig` lets a project declare itself without per-client config.
- Cross-project recall is a single flag, not a custom script.

**Negative**
- Adds a registration step ("register before use") — friction for one-off projects.
- Resolution chain is one more thing to debug when "the wrong project loaded".
