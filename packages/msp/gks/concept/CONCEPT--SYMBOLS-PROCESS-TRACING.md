# CONCEPT — End-to-end process tracing

## Problem
Developers and Agents often struggle to understand the "big picture" of how a request flows through a codebase. While we have a Symbol Graph, it is a collection of static relationships. We need a way to synthesize these relationships into a coherent execution flow (e.g., "What happens when I call this API?").

## Hypothesis
By walking the `CALLS` and `HANDLES` edges from recognized architectural entry points (detected via framework-awareness), we can reconstruct the execution paths of the system. This enables deep impact analysis and better code understanding.

## Scope
- Identification of entry points (API routes, tool handlers).
- Path traversal from entry points to leaf functions or external service calls.
- Cycle detection and depth limiting.
- Visualization of flows as ordered sequences of calls.

## Out of scope
- Dynamic dispatch resolution (at least in v1).
- Variable-level data flow tracking.
- Cross-service distributed tracing.

## Verification
- Existence of valid paths from a known entry point to a known leaf.
- Cycle detection prevents infinite loops in recursive code.
