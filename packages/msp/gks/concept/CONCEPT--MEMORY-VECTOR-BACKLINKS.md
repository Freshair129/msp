# CONCEPT — vector / backlinks

> **Updated 2026-05-04 (M7-prep follow-up)**: per `ADR--GRAPH-IS-GKS-DOMAIN`, atomic graph traversal (incl. backlinks derivation) is GKS scope per `SCOPE.md`. The MSP-side indexer (`src/memory/backlinks/`) is **temporary** — kept until GKS exposes a stable `gks backlinks` API (drafted in `upstream/gks-proposals/`). Once upstream lands, this concept evolves to "MSP consumes GKS-derived backlinks" and the writer is removed.

The third memory layer is a flat edge list under `vector/backlinks.jsonl`. Each line is one directed edge `{ from, to, type }`. Used for two things: (1) reverse traversal during `gks verify-flow`, (2) hybrid retrieval fusion (RRF) when an agent asks "what depends on this?".

## Path

```
.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/vector/backlinks.jsonl
```

## Schema

```json
{ "from": "FEAT--MSP-VALIDATOR", "to": "ADR--MSP-VALIDATOR", "type": "implements" }
{ "from": "FEAT--MSP-VALIDATOR", "to": "CONCEPT--MSP-VALIDATOR", "type": "references" }
{ "from": "BLUEPRINT--MSP-VALIDATOR", "to": "FEAT--MSP-VALIDATOR", "type": "implements" }
```

`type` is one of the predicates from `FRAME--CROSSLINKS-VOCABULARY`.

## How it's built

```
gks/<type>/<ID>.md frontmatter `crosslinks.*`
   │
   ▼
re-indexer (npm run msp:index) walks every atom, emits one edge per crosslinks entry
   │
   ▼
vector/backlinks.jsonl   (sorted by `from` for deterministic diffs)
```

The reverse index is computed in-memory at lookup time — no separate file.

## Hybrid retrieval (RRF)

`FRAMEWORK_MASTER_SPEC.md` §13 defines a 4-layer Reciprocal Rank Fusion across:

1. **Atomic** (exact ID lookup)
2. **Vector** (semantic neighbours)
3. **Obsidian** (graph + fulltext)
4. **Episodic** (per-session context)

The backlinks file feeds layer 3 (graph). MSP doesn't implement RRF itself — the orchestrator above does — but it owns the on-disk shape this file takes.

## Why JSONL not graph DB

- JSONL is git-diffable (humans can review additions in PRs).
- JSONL is grep-able (easy debugging).
- The graph is small enough (typical project: thousands of edges) that loading the full file into memory is < 50ms.
- A real graph DB (Kuzu, Neo4j) is an upstream optimisation — not blocked here. Tracked at M10b.

## Planned upstream migration

Per `ADR--GRAPH-IS-GKS-DOMAIN`, the indexer logic moves to GKS once the upstream patch in `upstream/gks-proposals/03-backlinks-api.md` lands. Then:

| Now | After upstream |
|---|---|
| MSP runs `npm run msp:backlinks` to derive `vector/backlinks.jsonl` | `gks backlinks --emit=jsonl` derives + emits |
| MSP `src/memory/backlinks/` ~200 LoC | thin caller (~20 LoC) — `import { backlinks } from '@evaai/gks'` |
| `FEAT--MEMORY-BACKLINKS-INDEXER` status: stable | bumped → `superseded_by: GKS native API` |
| AUDIT atom records the migration | — |

Not blocking for M7 — the temporary code works correctly today.
