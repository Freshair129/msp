# CONCEPT — decision atrophy guards

## Problem

ADRs have `valid_until` semantics in some atoms (e.g. `CONCEPT--MSP-ROADMAP` has `valid_until: 2026-08-01`). When that date passes:

- The atom is **silently stale** — nothing alerts the team
- Agents continue citing it as authoritative
- Drift between "what we said" and "what we now believe" isn't visible until someone happens to re-read

A library of "enforced lies" forms over months.

## Two guards

### Guard 1 — `valid_until_check` (CI / weekly cron)

A scheduled job that scans `gks/` for atoms with `valid_until` past `now()`. Emits:
- A list to a designated `STALE_ATOMS` issue (or local file `stale_atoms.md`)
- Optional: PR comment when a touched atom has `valid_until` in next 30 days

### Guard 2 — `valid_until` required for certain atom types

Some atoms inherently age (project plans, embedded benchmarks, time-bound preferences). Required-fields contract gets:

```yaml
roadmap_concepts:
  required_frontmatter: [valid_until]
  default_valid_period_days: 90
```

Applied to atoms tagged `tags: [roadmap, planning, ...]` (or per-id pattern).

## Why a CONCEPT not just a PROTO

This is bigger than one rule:
- M9a-1 = the scanning job (PROTO)
- M9a-2 = the required-fields contract update
- M9a-3 = process — what to do with stale atoms (review / supersede / update)

The CONCEPT captures the lifecycle aspect; specific PROTOs follow.

## Trigger

- **valid_until_check PROTO**: weekly CI cron, plus on-demand via `npm run msp:check-stale`
- **required-fields**: existing validator rule (M5d infrastructure)

## Severity

`warning` — atrophy is a process concern, not a CI fail. Emits to issue-tracker / stdout.

## Out of scope

- Auto-supersede of stale atoms (humans review, decide)
- ML predicting which atoms will age fastest
