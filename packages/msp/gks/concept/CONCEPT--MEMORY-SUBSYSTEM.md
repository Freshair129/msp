# CONCEPT — MSP memory subsystem

MSP keeps three independent memory stores under `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/`. They are **for audit, not for full context reload** — the rule is that agents access memory selectively through ID references, never by replaying entire history (that would explode token budgets).

## Three layers

| Layer | Path | Shape | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sessions** | `sessions/<episodicId>.jsonl` | linear append-only JSONL, one row per turn | replay an exact conversation in order |
| **Episodic** | `memory/episodic_memory.json` | rich JSON with summary + key_decisions + tags | jump to a high-importance event by ID |
| **Vector / Backlinks** | `vector/backlinks.jsonl` | edge list `{from, to, type}` | hybrid retrieval (RRF) per `FRAMEWORK_MASTER_SPEC.md` §13 |

## Read patterns

| Need | Tool | Result |
|---|---|---|
| "Show me turn 42 of session sess_001" | grep `sessions/sess_001.jsonl` for `turnId: 42` | one JSONL row |
| "What were the key decisions of episode ep_007?" | read `episodic_memory.json` filter by `episodicId` | one JSON object |
| "Find atoms semantically near `query`" | hybrid query → vector + obsidian + atomic + episodic, fused via RRF | top-K hits |
| "What references this atom?" | walk `backlinks.jsonl` reversed | edge list |

## What does NOT live here

- The canonical SSOT (atoms) — that's `gks/`
- The validator state — stateless, runs each invocation
- Pending proposals — `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/inbound/`

## Why "for audit, not full reload"

If every agent turn pulled the entire session JSONL, a 50-turn conversation would re-feed ~50,000 tokens before the first reply. The rule is: agents fetch by ID (a specific turn / episode / atom), not by sequence.
