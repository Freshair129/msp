> ⚠️ **Superseded by [`CONCEPT--KNOWLEDGE-LAYERS-V2`](./CONCEPT--KNOWLEDGE-LAYERS-V2.md)** (Phase 4 of `BLUEPRINT--INBOUND-TO-CANDIDATES-MIGRATION`, 2026-05-09). The inbound queue has been removed; runtime atom proposals now write to `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/candidates/` via the `msp_candidate` MCP tool. The body below is preserved as historical context.

# CONCEPT — inbound queue

The inbound queue is the only place agents are allowed to drop atoms intended for `gks/`. Direct writes to `gks/<type>/` are blocked by filesystem ACL and the pre-commit hook.

## Why a queue at all

Without one, four failure modes appear immediately:

1. **SSOT corruption** — agents overwrite approved atoms with wrong data.
2. **ID collision** — two agents pick the same `ADR-007`.
3. **Frontmatter hallucination** — agents synthesise fields like `commit_hash`.
4. **Dangling crosslinks** — `[[FEAT--XXX]]` points at nothing.

The queue gives the validator + human reviewer a chokepoint where each violation is caught before it pollutes the canonical store.

## Lifecycle

```
.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/inbound/<ID>.rev-<reviewId>.md
   │
   ├── (a) validator passes  → human approves  → gks/<type>/<ID>.md
   │
   ├── (b) validator fails   → .../rejected/<YYYY-MM-DD>/  + rejection_reason.md
   │
   └── (c) reviewer rejects  → same rejected dir + reviewer + reason
```

## Filename convention

```
{yyyymmddHHMMSS}-{agent_id}-{proposal_type}-{slug}.md   # legacy / spec
{ID}.rev-{reviewId}.md                                   # GKS published
```

The current `@freshair129/gks` package uses the `rev-` form; MSP accepts either at the validator boundary.

## What this concept does NOT describe

- The exact frontmatter envelope → see `CONCEPT--SUBMISSION-ENVELOPE`
- The proposal types (new/update/supersede/deprecate) → see `CONCEPT--PROPOSAL-TYPES`
- The promote command + level transitions → see `ADR--PROMOTION-LEVELS`
