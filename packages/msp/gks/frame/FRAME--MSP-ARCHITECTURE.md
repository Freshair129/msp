# FRAME — MSP architecture (v1, superseded)

MSP sits between agents (T1/T2/T3 — Claude / Gemini / SLM) and the canonical knowledge store under `gks/`. It refuses any direct write to `gks/`; the only legal path is the inbound queue.

## Write flow (one direction)

```
Agent → /submit-memory → .brain/msp/projects/<ns>/inbound/
         → MSP validator → human review → gks/<type>/
                                          + atomic_index.jsonl
```

Each arrow is a hard gate. Bypass attempts are caught at:

| Gate | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Direct write to `gks/` | filesystem ACL + git pre-commit hook |
| Schema violation | MSP validator (forbidden fields, ID format, dangling wikilinks, …) |
| Wrong reviewer | promote workflow requires explicit human approval |
| Missing chain | `gks verify-flow FEAT--<id>` exits 1 if any link is broken |

## Layers

| # | Layer | Owner | Path | What |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Contract | MSP maintainer | `.brain/msp/LLM_Contract/` | YAML schemas the validator reads |
| 2 | Inbound | Agents (write), MSP (read) | `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/inbound/` | candidate atoms + `.rev-XXXX` files |
| 3 | Rejected | MSP | `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/rejected/{date}/` | failed proposals + reason |
| 4 | Canonical | MSP (write via promote) | `gks/<type>/` | committed SSOT |
| 5 | Index | MSP (re-indexer) | `gks/00_index/atomic_index.jsonl` | derived; never hand-edit |
| 6 | Sessions | MSP | `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/sessions/*.jsonl` | linear conversation history |
| 7 | Episodic | MSP | `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/memory/episodic_memory.json` | rich event summaries |
| 8 | Vector / Backlinks | MSP | `.brain/msp/projects/<ns>/vector/` | hybrid retrieval edges |
